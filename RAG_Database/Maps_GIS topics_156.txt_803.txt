GEODI is distinguished by its ability to produce maps using both structured and unstructured data, unlike traditional GIS software that requires tabular data. It can recognize locations from various unstructured sources, such as a place name in a PDF, a parcel number in a document, or a kilometer value in a road project. This capability allows GEODI to integrate a large volume of data that might not schematically fit together. Beyond geographic maps, GEODI can also utilize non-traditional images, like an electrical diagram or a picture of an airplane, as a "map."

GEODI allows users to define map underlays, with ready-made definitions available for Google and Bing, though users are responsible for any associated royalties or fees. Underlay options are found in the Layer List within the Project Wizard and include user-provided images, CAD files such as DWG/DGN, and other file types like GPX, geoTIFF, KML, or TileJSON/WMS Servers. These underlays are specific to a project, meaning that if project files are shared, the corresponding underlay files must also be shared.

For underlays to function in GEODI, they must have a coordinate system, requiring the input of an appropriate EPSG code and corresponding limit coordinate values (BBOX). This method enables the use of any image as a map, exemplified by the Cessna 172 in the "interactive documentation" project. If a desired EPSG value is not among existing definitions, WKT values must be created in a file named "EPSG-.WKT" within the GEODI/Projections directory. Defining custom EPSG values at 100000 and above helps prevent conflicts with existing EPSG codes, and these assigned values should be shared when projects are shared. Resources like http://www.epsg-registry.org and projection tools from GIS software such as ArcGIS or Netcad can assist in producing WKT from EPSG.

For CAD files, specifically DWG, DGN, DXF, or NCZ formats, that have an unknown projection, GEODI provides a method to define their projection using an external metafile. This process leverages GEODI's generic external feature definition capability. Defining projections for DWG and DGN files that contain plans or maps is noted to enhance the usefulness of the GeoArchive and CAD&GIS viewer modules.

GEODI maps can be utilized in various other software applications through the OGC WMS (Web Map Service) standard, enabling compatibility with software like ArcGIS, netcad GIS, Autocad Civil 3D, GeoServer, Google Earth, and applications using Open Layers or Leaflet infrastructures. GEODI supports the OGC WMS 1.3.0 standard, which means that clicking on the map in client applications supporting this standard will open a dialog within GEODI. WMS provides a live connection, allowing changes to queries on the GEODI side to be reflected in the published map, though users experiencing issues with changes should check the relevant software's cache settings.

To access the active GEODI project via WMS, the address http://127.0.0.1:3323/wms can be used. To publish a map of a specific project, the address format is http://127.0.0.1:3323/wms?wsname=[Project Name], where "[Project Name]" must be replaced with the actual project name, and spaces within the project name should be replaced with "%20", as demonstrated by the example http://127.0.0.1:3323/wms?wsname=deneme%20proje.

GEODI offers several options for exporting or integrating its maps with other systems. Users can export a GEODI Map as KML, though KML exports are not dynamic and are unaffected by GEODI queries or new content. A GeoJSON report can be generated to export selected locations, which is compatible with ArcGIS and other GIS software, and includes links for each geometric entity to allow users to open documents from ArcGIS. Additionally, a free ArcGIS Enterprise Widget is available, enabling ArcGIS Enterprise users to search for and open documents directly through GEODI.

Problems with reading, viewing, or using shapefiles as a dictionary in GEODI can arise from missing or incorrect shapefile projections. When a projection problem occurs, the PRJ file needs to be edited or recreated. Such issues are directly displayed during operations like dictionary preparation and are recorded in the scan log file during scanning. An example of GEODI not recognizing a projection is the error message "Missing projection parameter 'latitude_of_origin' It is also not defined as 'latitude_of_center'. Parameter name: parameterNam". To edit a PRJ file, it is necessary to create a Projection WKT using another software that recognizes the file's projection, such as ArcGIS, Netcad, or resources like https://www.epsg-registry.org, and then modify the PRJ content. Users can also send their problematic Shape file or PRJ file to GEODI for assistance.

If "strange" characters appear in short summaries when viewing records from shapefiles in GEODI, it indicates a character encoding issue. One solution is to create a CPG or CST file with the same name as the shapefile and write the encoding name, such as UTF-8 or ISO-..., into it. If this method does not resolve the encoding problem, an alternative is to back up the DBF file located in the same directory as the SHP file, then open the DBF file with software like OpenOffice, select the correct encoding, and save the file with its original name and extension. It is crucial to back up the DBF file before this process, as errors may occur when the SHP file is subsequently viewed with different programs.
