Based on GEODI discovery results, files and databases can be Masked or Anonymized. Masking involves obscuring sensitive data within content or replacing it with a fixed alternative text, which completely removes the sensitive data. Anonymization, conversely, replaces a value with another value that appears real, breaking the link with the original data while maintaining its realistic appearance. Anonymizing sensitive information or databases facilitates their sharing with test teams, data analysis teams, or researchers.

In Anonymization, each value is replaced with a compatible alternative, such as a name with another name or a phone number with another phone number. Ready-to-use values for anonymization include Name, Money, Dictionaries (Placename, part number or other), Creditcard, IBAN, Tel, e-Mail, and Date. Anonymization offers two modes: a Default mode where the same value consistently converts to the same alternative everywhere, and another mode where conversion is always random, preventing identical results even within a single session. The second mode is configured in the project's generic settings.

Profiles define which findings are to be anonymized, allowing users to anonymize all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Financial data. The system's functions prompt users to select from existing profiles to apply these anonymization settings.

Anonymization in content can be applied in several ways. Persistent File Anonymization modifies identified discovery layers permanently or creates an anonymous copy of the original file-based data. Dynamic Anonymization changes selected discovery layers dynamically for specific groups or users, allowing different users to see varying levels of data, such as one user seeing a complete document while another sees hidden monetary fields or personal data. Database anonymization creates a masked or anonymized copy of a database, enabling software development teams to work with a masked version.

Persistent File Anonymization involves GEODI creating a copy of the content undergoing masking, functioning in a "Mask and Download" manner. This operation can be performed in bulk using the “Batch Mask/Anonymize” action, which generates a script for system administrators, or for individual files via the masking/anonymization feature within the viewer. Masking supports various formats including Word (*.doc, *.docx, *.rtf), Excel (*.xlsm, *.csv, *.xlsx, *.xls), PDF (*.pdf), Powerpoint (*.ppt, *.pptx, *.ppsx), and LibreOffice (*.odp, *.odt, *.ods). Masking profiles enable the creation of templates to mask all or specific data like PII, allowing for different masking formats based on identifiers, such as masking a name like "Hasan Hüseyin" as "[NAME]" or "****".

Dynamic Anonymization ensures that discovery results are masked and visible on screens such as the viewer, words, network graph, and summary. Masking in the viewer applies to Office Files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), Open Office (ODT, ODS, ...), PDF, TXT, and XPS, regardless of their source. This feature is activated by selecting the "Dynamic Masking" box and configuring settings on the project wizard's last page, after which files are displayed to users in a masked format. It operates with group-based authorization, where a masking metadata is defined for each group, and group members see files masked according to this metadata. A "No Masking" setting can display results without masking for a defined group, and any group or user not matched with a profile defaults to the MaskALL profile. Files downloaded are also in a masked form.

Database anonymization performs permanent masking on a specified database, with the option to work on a copy to preserve the original data. This feature supports use cases such as sharing databases with software or testing teams, where sensitive data is permanently removed, and sharing databases for data analysis, ensuring safe data sharing by removing sensitive information.

Permissions for masking are aligned with document download permissions, meaning users with download permission can utilize masking. Dynamic masking further allows authorization at both the user and discovery layer levels. Anonymization requires a mask and DISCOVERY license, and the number of users for this license corresponds to the total number of GEODI users.
