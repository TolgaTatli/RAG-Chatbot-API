GEODI Classifier is a set of tools designed for manual or automatic data classification. It includes plug-ins for Microsoft Office, Exchange Server, Office 365, and Windows. These Classifier solutions are compatible with Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions such as ForcePoint, Symantec, and TrendMicro. The plug-ins are not activated until both GEODI and GEODI Classifier licenses are installed.

The Desktop Classifier plugin, once installed, adds a "classify" option to the Windows right-click menu. The specific options available through this feature may vary based on server settings. This method generates tags for formats that support them, such as Office documents and PDFs, and these tags are then interpreted by DLP solutions. For file types that do not support tags, the system writes tags using a feature of the NTFS file system, which is also compatible with DLP solutions.

For Microsoft Office applications, the installation of GEODI Classifier plugins adds a menu to the "Home" tab. Supported applications include Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Outlook; compatible versions are detailed in the system requirements document. The options presented within these applications can differ based on server settings, allowing users to manually or automatically select the document's class. Depending on the chosen class, the system determines which labels are written, whether a watermark is present, and its appearance, all based on user settings.

When a document is saved or exported as a PDF, the classification options are requested again. Depending on the configured settings, it may not be possible to save the document without first selecting a class.

Automatic classification within GEODI Classifier is powered by GEODI's discovery capabilities. The rules that dictate which class will be created are configurable within the server settings. This allows for the creation of classes such as "Confidential/Private" and distinctions like "with/without personal data."

The system supports the creation of watermarks and footers based on the document's class. The classification tool attempts to place class values and watermarks in the most suitable location, with the specific values written depending on defined settings. Header, Footer, and WaterMark values can be displayed and positioned as right, left, or centered, though not necessarily all of them simultaneously.

In applications like Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, which offer extensive layout, font, and size options, it may not always be possible to insert class values without affecting the document's existing content. In such instances, users are advised to try the provided options or modify their templates to accommodate the classification values. Any situations that occur with manually created headers/footers also apply to GEODI tags. For example, the footer might not be displayed in some Office versions when printing a portrait-formatted page horizontally. If document margins are fully utilized, GEODI class labels will inevitably overlap with existing content, requiring the user to reserve space for the label.

When the computer in use cannot access the GEODI server, only manual classification can be performed with the classification tools. Logs of classifications made during these offline periods will be transferred to the server once the connection is re-established. During offline periods, the classification tools will attempt to connect to the servers, which may result in slightly longer startup times. In such a case, users should contact their companyâ€™s IT department to resolve the issue.

Classification policies and rules for the classes and tools are centrally managed. When these rules are updated, the interfaces will reflect these changes the next time a user logs in.
