Enterprise Search Applications are tools that enable institutions and companies to search data from various sources. Unlike the Google Search Engine, which operates on open web data, corporate search software works with an organization's internal data, accessible only to its personnel. This approach ensures data safety and allows for authorization control. GEODI Server incorporates all features of an enterprise search application and additional capabilities.

GEODI facilitates searches across both internal and external data resources. Internal data sources include file servers, personal computers, databases, intranet pages, Electronic Document Management Systems, Document Archive Systems, ERP, CRM, GIS, MIS application databases, cloud servers like Dropbox, and e-mail servers. External data sources that GEODI can search include Internet pages, Social Media accounts, and Blogs.

A key advantage of GEODI over other enterprise search engines is its ability to display search results on maps or diagrams. This method of reporting results, as opposed to long lists, enhances convenience and user experience. Map information specifically helps in revealing locational relationships among the data, which is a significant improvement compared to a classic search.

GEODI performs an "active search" by extracting specific numbers and information from content even before a search is initiated. This pre-search extraction includes details such as ID numbers, names of persons, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, tax numbers, bank accounts, clauses of legislation, and part numbers. This capability allows users to know what information is available in advance, which can be highly beneficial.

GEODI can extract information that traditional search engines, including Google, might not find. For instance, GEODI is capable of finding all texts within CAD files, supporting formats like DWG, DGN, NCZ, and Catia, whereas other search engines are not interested in CAD file contents. Additionally, GEODI can locate e-mails, e-mail attachments, and documents embedded within these attachments, such as ZIP and RAR files.

GEODI possesses the capability to detect the language in which documents are written, supporting languages such as English, Turkish, and Chinese. For multilingual documents, it can identify the language of each individual paragraph. GEODI enables searches across all resources, whether internal or external, using various criteria. Users can search for documents based on the presence or absence of specific words or phrases, similar words, document types like images or PDF documents, creation dates (before, after, or between certain dates), specific sources, or combinations of these criteria. Furthermore, GEODI allows for the analysis of search words to help streamline business processes.
