Confluence/Wiki directories are indexed and discovered in the same way as Windows directories. File neglect rules are applicable to these directories.

Users can explore pages within their Confluence Online permissions. This exploration requires entering a username and password.

With Confluence Public, external resources can be discovered. This discovery is achieved by providing only the domain.

Documents found on pages discovered using the “Include Attachments” option will be indexed. It is important to consider that this option will lead to an increase in indexing time.

To discover a private address, username and password information must be utilized.
