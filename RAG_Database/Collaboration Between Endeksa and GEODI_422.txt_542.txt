Endeksa, which provides value estimation with artificial intelligence, and GEODI, which offers AI-supported data discovery, archiving, and protection services, have signed a collaboration. This partnership is intended to add value to the real estate sector. Through this collaboration, parcel and housing movements in open source data are collected 24/7 using artificial intelligence technology. As a result, Endeksa member users can easily access all official announcements in the area, such as zoning announcements and council decisions. This collaboration was signed on December 8, 2023.

Endeksa enables the valuation of real estate within seconds using its automated valuation model, in addition to providing regional real estate values and forecasts. The company collects parcel and housing movements in open source data by utilizing GEODI technology. The collected data serves as input for Endeksa's automated real estate valuation algorithms and is also provided directly to Endeksa users. Endeksa serves thousands of real estate agents across Turkey, as well as individual users, construction developers, financial institutions, retail companies, and public institutions. The new feature, powered by GEODI technology, allows Endeksa members to easily access official announcements in the area, including zoning announcements and council decisions.

GEODI is a data discovery engine that uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing. In its collaboration with Endeksa, GEODI collects parcel and housing movements in open source data, which Endeksa then uses as input for its AI model. The data flow is very fast, making manual processing practically impossible, and GEODI performs this task automatically 24/7. Serdar Ak, Founder and CEO of Dece Software, expressed pride that GEODI technology is being utilized by Endeksa, which he described as one of the sector's key players.

Görkem Öğüt, Co-Founder and CEO of Endeksa, stated that since its inception, Endeksa has aimed for the technology-driven development of the sector and the democratization of data. He noted that Endeksa supports sector stakeholders with the analyses and features it offers related to the real estate sector. Öğüt expressed pleasure in implementing another important feature that will contribute to the sector through the collaboration with GEODI, and indicated that Endeksa plans to offer users different features developed with GEODI in the coming period.
