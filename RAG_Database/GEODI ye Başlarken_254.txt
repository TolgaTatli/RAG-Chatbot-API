GEODI is designed to simplify the work of employees in both office and field environments. It aims to speed up information access and facilitate sharing. GEODI is easy to use, allowing users to start immediately after a very short training, and its ease of use increases with continued use. User trainings are available on the GEODI Trainings page. These pages provide information on how to use GEODI and detailed information for system administrators.

The GEODI Search Page is the most frequently used page within the system. Users can access various features from this page, including searches, different viewing modes like Map and Calendar, note-taking functionalities, reports, and panels.

On the GEODI Search Page, users can input their search queries, which can include words and more. Search results appear in a dedicated area, where users can scroll through them using the mouse wheel. The total number of found contents is displayed in the top left corner. Clicking on any content lists various options, including "Open" to view the content, with options varying by content type. Note-taking, copy, and similar content options are also available, and Ctrl-clicking opens the content directly in the area. The Facet area is available to make queries more practical.

GEODI allows users to view search results in different formats, including Contents, Explorer, Map, and Calendar. The "Contents" view lists files and other content from the search result, allowing scrolling with the mouse wheel. The "Explorer" view provides a Windows Explorer-like structure for navigating content directories, enabling users to see and navigate directories containing their contents. The "Map" view displays locations from contents on a map, enabling access to contents by clicking the map. The "Calendar" view automatically generates a calendar from date information within contents, allowing access to documents by clicking specific dates. Additionally, a "Notes" panel is available to track notes and the contents they were taken on, with the possibility of other panels existing in a user's environment. The 3-dot menu on the GEODI Search Page provides users with various options, including language selection, reporting functionalities, and view settings.

GEODI includes Content Viewers that allow direct viewing of numerous content types without requiring additional software. While a Word document is used as an example, GEODI provides different viewers for various content types such as DWG, NCZ, Videos, and Emails. The following descriptions cover common features across all these viewers.

Within the GEODI content viewer, users can view documents, scroll up or down using the mouse wheel, and zoom in or out with Ctrl + mouse movement. Users can also take notes anywhere in the document by right-clicking. If multiple contents match search criteria, users can open them sequentially without returning to the search results. A panel on the right side of the viewer displays information such as words/metadata within the content, notes, copies, and versions, with different attachments potentially appearing for different content types.

The content viewer provides options for downloading and masking. Users can download a version older than the latest by using the Shift+download combination, provided that backup is enabled for older versions. Downloading is available if the user has the necessary authorization, and masking is an option if a masking license is available. Additionally, users can perform searches within the currently open document.

After GEODI version 7.0.1.26858, it became possible to download documents viewed in the viewer. This functionality is currently available for *.dwg files if the viewer supports it from backup. To download the newest version of a versioned document from the ES interface, users can utilize the Shift+Download key combination.
