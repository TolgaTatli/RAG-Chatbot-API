GEODI operates under the motto Search-Discover-Classify-Mask. While data discovery is often discussed in relation to regulations such as KVKK or PCI/DSS, GEODI offers capabilities beyond what these regulations require. GEODI is an expert in uncovering hidden value in data through various methods. The discovery process itself provides benefits, allowing for a better understanding of data leakage risks, aiding in comprehending data that needs protection, and ultimately enhancing security.

The network graph is a GEODI tool designed to reveal deeper relationships within data, uncovering insights not apparent from lists or documents alone. This tool is beneficial for professionals such as lawyers, press advisors, independent auditors, inspectors, experts, managers, and individuals involved in digital forensics. The network graph tools are easy to use and produce effective results.

A network graph is composed of nodes connected by lines, similar to a road network. In the GEODI network graph, the nodes represent either words (which are the discoveries made) or documents. The lines in the graph illustrate the relationships between these nodes. The network graph is included as part of the GEODI Discovery package.

Network graph analysis is a complex process. Given that GEODI performs data discovery at terabyte and petabyte levels, it is not feasible to visualize all relationships in a single graph due to the lack of an understandable visual and performance constraints. While GEODI's general performance applies to the network graph within physical limitations, users should narrow down the data to obtain meaningful results. GEODI makes adjustments to enhance visual clarity, and users can stop or restart the process by changing the query. The network graph initially loads data at one or two levels, with options to load additional levels via navigation. The process may occasionally strain the computer, requiring some time.

Navigation within the GEODI network graph allows users to zoom in and out using the mouse wheel, similar to a map, to enlarge areas of interest. Right-clicking on any node provides access to associated documents and their properties. To load an additional level of data in the network graph, users can utilize the expand function.

Document-Word Relationships in GEODI's network graph address what is discovered within a document. In this analysis, documents are central, with elements like names, dates, places, and credit cards linked by lines within the document. If the same name appears in another document, it connects to the same node, enabling the tracking of relationships between documents. Users can refine discovery results in the facet area to focus on specific entities like names and credit cards. Deeper analyses can be conducted using proximity operators.

Word-Document Relationships represent the inverse of Document-Word analysis. In this view, a name is positioned at the center, with connections extending to all documents where that specific name appears.

In Word-Word analysis, documents are not directly involved but serve as an indirect link. Words that appear within the same document are connected to each other in this type of relationship.

GEODI supports over 200 data sources, ensuring comprehensive coverage of digital data. It processes scanned documents using OCR technology and integrates with various file types, including databases, Word, Excel, Open Office files, emails, UYAP files, videos, and images. This extensive capability means GEODI can process invoices, reports, proposals, project files, specifications, contracts, and other similar documents without exception. New data sources can always be added to GEODI's supported list.
