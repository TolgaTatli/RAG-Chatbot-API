Basic search rules in GEODI are similar to those of Google, Bing, or other search engines. GEODI searches for given criteria across all sources connected to a project. This includes all data sources, files, social media, or databases, unless the target is specifically limited. The term “CONTENT” is used to address all types of data, such as a file, a tweet, or a row in a database.

Users can search for any word(s), and the search is case-insensitive, meaning that the upper or lower case does not affect the results. To search for an exact phrase where words must appear next to each other, users should enclose the phrase in quotation marks. The asterisk symbol “*” can be used at the beginning or end of a word to represent an unknown part. The minus symbol “-” reverses any rule, while the tilde symbol “~” is used when the spelling is uncertain.

For date searches, users can simply write a date or a date range. GEODI's semantic search abilities allow it to find all relevant content regardless of how the date is written. To search for personal notes or notes created by others, specific syntax is used. Any of the search rules can be used together. There are also additional rules available in the facet area on the left, which allow users to add more criteria related to content types, sources, and recognizers.
