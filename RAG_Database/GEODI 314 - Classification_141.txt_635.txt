The scope indicates that after GEODI installation, which is covered in GEODI 301, the GEODI Classifier is already installed. This module includes a ready-to-use template called Classifier Template. A roadmap and checklist are available for a typical classification project, and it is suggested that users follow these.

The initial project created using the Classifier Template contains ready-to-use classes, allowing for direct use. Modifications are also possible for Classes, Rules, Annotations, and customization by groups.

Users are ready to deploy agents, with agent deployment covered in GEODI 315. OWA deployment is covered in GEODI 316. End user training is covered in GEODI 121, and this course assumes the use of default classes, suggesting that an extra guideline might be desired for specific environments.
