The GEODI note mechanism provides a practical and effective way to collaborate. Taking notes helps you avoid unnecessary emails and the chaos of documents attached to those emails. When reviewing a contract, editing becomes much easier based on the notes your colleagues have taken on the clauses. Document versioning ensures that the entire process and participants are logged.

With GEODI CAD & GIS viewers, you can take spatial notes directly on locations. A similar scenario can be applied to an architectural project or any spatial data format supported by GEODI. Notes guide individuals directly to the relevant points, eliminating uncertainties. The note you take on a Word or PDF file will navigate to the relevant page. The note you take on an AutoCAD or Netcad file will navigate to the relevant coordinate. The note you take on a video will navigate to the relevant second (timestamp).

"Note" is also a document type. You can query only notes using "doc:*.geodinote." You can search within note content; for example, using "doc:*.geodinote positive" will find notes containing the word "positive." Based on the content of the note, you can search for the main document; using ‘child:”positive”’ will query documents associated with the note containing "positive." You can query notes taken on a document using the "parent2:" expression, and you can also generate a report of notes taken on a document. You can search based on the user who took the note using the "owner:" expression.

The Notes panel allows you to view the notes taken and the documents on which notes were taken, which makes it easier to track processes. You can determine who will see each note. You can mention other users within notes using "@" and enable email notifications for them, with the email notification providing direct access to the page where the note was taken in the document for the recipient. When taking notes, GEODI identifiers are active, and recognized content is marked accordingly. If there is a defined status dictionary based on the source, you can ensure standard note-taking.

GEODI's Process Management features, such as note-taking, dashboards, queries, and monitoring, provide practical process management and traceability. You can see the status of tasks through dashboards or queries. You can create custom dashboards that perfectly fit the needs of your organization according to your requirements.

In classical software, a process starts with a record, but with GEODI, process management starts with a document. This approach simplifies tasks, prevents unnecessary data entry, and allows you to focus on the work.

For example, the process for a job application starts with a CV document, without needing additional data entry. In traditional software, a lot of information already present in the CV, such as the person's name, school, date of birth, and certifications, would have to be re-entered, but GEODI saves you from such unnecessary tasks. Simply drag and drop the CV to start the process, and there is no need to separately associate certificates or other documents with the person, as GEODI automatically recognizes and associates names or ID numbers. Those evaluating the application are notified of the documents you added, provide their positive/negative feedback, which is then sent to those organizing the interviews, allowing the process to continue smoothly.

Another example is related to social media, which has become an indispensable platform for institutions and companies to reach out to and listen to citizens or users. If a complaint is received via social media, the message is considered a document in GEODI, and you can take notes. Writing the name of the relevant person or department in the note is enough for the concerned parties to be informed. With GEODI's intelligent methods, it is also possible to automatically determine the relevant department based on the content.

For municipalities or provincial special administrations, many stakeholders are involved in construction permit processes, including the municipality, building inspection companies, contractors, and property owners. With GEODI, it is very easy to monitor processes and ensure that all necessary documents are collected completely. You can learn from the experiences of users such as Aksaray Municipality and Artvin Provincial Special Administration through webinars.

Project processes are another example, where construction companies and engineering offices produce many projects in formats such as AutoCAD, Microstation, Netcad, ArcGIS, or GeoTIFF. Throughout the maturation process of these projects, numerous versions are created. Tracking these files can be difficult and error-prone due to different file names saved in directories and attachments received via email. GEODI simplifies the maturation process, and in addition to versioning, it reduces errors by finding similar and duplicate documents.

Using GEODI provides speed, practicality, and smoothness, serving as an alternative to process management software based on manual data entry, which employees or external stakeholders may find difficult to comply with.
