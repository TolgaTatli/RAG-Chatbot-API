After a discovery is completed, the results require inspection. GEODI offers multiple methods for this, including reports, panels, and predefined queries. This section provides specific details regarding the predefined queries.

The `predefined:PCI` query is utilized to inspect discovery results related to PCI/DSS. This query identifies content and sources that contain PCI/DSS findings, encompassing credit card, CVV, PIN, or Password findings. GEODI presents all relevant content, and a facet displays details about data sources and the number of findings. This provides an initial insight into conforming and non-conforming sources, allowing users to implement precautions such as deletion or quarantine actions. The process can be repeated until no findings are detected on risky sources.

Queries within GEODI influence both reports and panels. Specific reports are available to provide more detailed information when needed.

The `predefined:PII` query is designed to identify PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data, covering all relevant rules found in GDPR and other regulations. The operational details for this query are consistent with those mentioned for `predefined:PCI`. GEODI's recognizers are developed to account for country-specific situations and various ID types, ensuring the `predefined:PII` query functions as expected across all countries.

GEODI simplifies the process of addressing legacy data older than 5 years for actions like deletion, quarantine, or masking through the use of predefined queries. The `predefined:O5Y` query specifically targets legacy data older than five years, considering only content dates. Additionally, the `predefined:O10Y` query allows for querying data older than 10 years.

Inspecting discovery results in GEODI requires appropriate permissions, and GEODI offers several ways to inspect these permissions. The `user:` query lists the content that a specific user or group is authorized to view. System administrators can also determine who can see a document by clicking on it.

GEODI provides various other predefined queries for specific content types. `predefined:Money` identifies content containing different money types, such as $, Euro, Pound, or KSA riyal. `predefined:CreditCard` covers over 10 credit card types, including test cards. `predefined:DB` returns database content, including SQL Server, Oracle, sqlite, and mdb types, which may be located on file servers or within mail attachments. `predefined:Videos` and `predefined:Images` query video and image content, respectively. `predefined:Web` targets web content, including emails. `predefined:Maskcontent` identifies content that can be masked. `predefined:Local` finds content that is local, not originating from the web or GDE. `predefined:GDE` queries content fed by GDE. The `Predefined:PII` query also finds PII findings and adapts itself to local rules and IDs. Furthermore, `predefined:AbleToClassifyByLabel-` and `predefined:AbleToClassifyByADS` query content types that are classifiable using Labelling/Tagging and ADS, and are recommended for use on panels, reports, and other relevant areas as the scope of labeling expands.
