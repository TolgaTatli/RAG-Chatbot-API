GEODI Classifier is the common name for a set of tools used for manual or automatic data classification.

GEODI Classifier has add-ons available for Microsoft Office, Exchange Server, Office 365, and Windows. Classifier solutions are compatible with DLP solutions such as ForcePoint, Symantec, and TrendMicro.

GEODI enables bulk classification for Office and PDF files. Documents intended for classification are selected through a search process and can then be classified either automatically or manually. This method allows for the classification of hundreds of thousands or even millions of documents in a very short timeframe.

As a search criterion for document classification, users can utilize criteria such as the presence of personal data within the documents.
