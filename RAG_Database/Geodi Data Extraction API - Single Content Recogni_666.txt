A Token can be obtained by generating a GEODI Token.

The RecognizeContent operation returns entries found by scanners in the current workspace from content sent by the user to GEODI.

A request for RecognizeContent can be made using the URL format: [GEODIURL]/DataExtractionHandler?op=RecognizeContent&wsName=[WSNAME]&content=[ContentJson]&UserSession=[TOKEN]. In this format, `wsName` represents the Workspace Name, and `content` is a JSON object containing content information, with object details available in the "Geodi ContentObject - Content Definition Object" document.

Alternatively, a RecognizeContent request can use the URL format: [GEODIURL]/DataExtractionHandler?op=RecognizeContent&wsName=[WSNAME]&fileName=[FileName]&UserSession=[TOKEN]. Both filename and content can be sent as bytes. An example request URL is [GEODIURL]/DataExtractionHandler?op=RecognizeContent&wsName=PROJE&fileName=myProj.doc, with an associated HTTP HEADER of Content-Length:1740 and a request body of 1740 byte[] Content.

The HttpMethod for RecognizeContent can be GET or POST. Expected errors include 401 Unauthorized access / Access denied, 403 Forbidden, 511 Network Authentication Required, and 501 Server Error.

The returning value for RecognizeContent is a JSON object containing "ElapsedMilliseconds" and an "Entries" list. "ElapsedMilliseconds" indicates milliseconds spent for recognition. "Entries" is a list of entrances recognized by GEODI. Each entry includes "OriginalText," which is the piece of text where recognition occurs; "Text," which is the text of the recognition made within the text; "StartIndex," OriginalText's starting position within the text (starting from 0); "Length," OriginalText's length; and "Filter," which is the value created for the entry, if any.

Additional fields within an entry include "StartDouble," representing the beginning of the value range; "EndDouble," representing the end of the range; "IsFixedValue," indicating whether the value is constant (False if it's a range value); and "RecognizerID," which is the ID of the recognizer that recognizes the word.

The "ValueTypeCode" is an Enum value corresponding to the value type, with equivalents as follows: 0: Empty, 1: Object, 2: DBNull, 3: Boolean, 4: Char, 5: SByte (-128, 127), 6: Byte (0, 255), 7: Int16 (-32768, 32767), 8: UInt16 (0, 65535), 9: Int32 (-2147483648, 2147483647), 10: UInt32 (0, 4294967295), 11: Int64 (-9223372036854775808, 9223372036854775807), 12: UInt64 (0, 18446744073709551615), 13: Single, 14: Double, 15: Decimal, 16: DateTime, and 18: String.

An example RecognizeContent request is shown with the URL [GEODIURL]/DataExtractionHandler?op=RecognizeContent. The request body includes `wsName: "PROJECT"`, `content` as a JSON object with `ContentURL: '~/MyApplication/Content.php?id=1465'`, `DisplayName:'Control list document'`, `ContentDate:'Mon, 04 May 2015 07:38:28 GMT'`, and `ViewURL: '~/MyApplication/ContentView.php?id=1465'`, along with `UserSession: "..."`.

Example applications for this functionality include .Net WinForm (C#) and HTML - Javascript.
