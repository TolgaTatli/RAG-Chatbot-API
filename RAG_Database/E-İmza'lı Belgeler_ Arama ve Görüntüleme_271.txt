GEODI displays signature and timestamp information for e-signed PDF files and enables searching based on this information. It increases reliability by eliminating the need for external verification methods.

Signature information for PDF documents signed with the PAdES method is automatically recognized during indexing. When a document is opened, this information is visible, including signature owners, timestamps, and certificate details. No additional action is required for GEODI to recognize e-signed documents, as GEODI handles this process automatically.

Searches within e-signatures can be performed using query commands such as `e-imza:...` or `signature:...`. For example, an `e-imza:”ad soyad”` search will find documents e-signed by the person named "ad soyad".

When an e-signed document is selected, all e-signature information can be seen on the right side. Discovered words originating from the e-signature are visible in the "Kelimeler" screen. E-signature details can also be viewed in the document viewer screen via the top-right "Info (İ)" button.
