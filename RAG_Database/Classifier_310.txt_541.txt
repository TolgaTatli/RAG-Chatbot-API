This page guides users through the server and user installations of GEODI Classifier.

Setting up and adapting manual or automatic classification projects is covered. Users can start immediately with ready classes if they have not used a classification tool before. If transitioning from a different tool, defining existing classes and labels can be done within similar timeframes.

GEODI's advanced classification policy manager allows for easy group, person, or software-based customization, ensuring flexibility if rules or policies change after deployment. Classification agents automatically update these policies.

For further inquiries, information is available on the GEODI Classifier SSS page.

To simplify management, panels for monitoring both classification agents and classification activities will be provided.

End-users need only watch the GEODI 121 Online training video to use the Office and Desktop add-ons.
