File Servers (Dosya Sunucular) can be discovered in a few different ways. If a share exists, the "Source: Klasör/Folder" or "Source: SSH" methods should be used for discovery.

If there is no share, or if the GEODI Service user's permissions are not sufficient, the GEODI Desktop Explorer (GDE) agent should be installed as a Windows Service. For more details, refer to "Keşif Ajanı - GEODI Desktop Explorer (GDE)".
