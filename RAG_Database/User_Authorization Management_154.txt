GEODI uses "Settings/User settings/Authorization Management" to create users and define authorizations and groups. This page includes a "Groups tab" for managing groups and their associated authorizations, and a "Users tab" for defining users, sending messages, and matching users with groups.

GEODI authorizations are assigned to groups. A "System administrator" group has the ability to create users and groups, and to add or remove users from groups. The recommended minimum groups to create are "GEODI Users", "GEODI Managers", and "GEODI System Administrators". The number of members in a group is specified, and a single user can be a member of multiple groups.

GEODI supports LDAP/Active Directory integration, requiring the GEODI-installed machine to be in the same domain. LDAP groups are not supported; authorization groups must be defined within GEODI. Management for users originating from LDAP takes place on the Active Directory side. Changes to passwords in LDAP affect GEODI, and users deleted from LDAP cannot access GEODI.

LDAP users are added to GEODI by mapping them to groups. When a user name is typed, if a similar user exists in LDAP, it is presented as an option to facilitate management in networks with many LDAP users. LDAP users appear as "domain\username", and their management is entirely handled on the AD side, meaning no additional options are provided for them within GEODI.

GEODI Notification services utilize the emails of LDAP users as defined on the AD side. GEODI also uses folder and file-based authorizations provided on the AD side. While GEODI cannot exceed AD side restrictions, it can establish new limits. To enable the use of folder authorizations from the AD side, the "SupportLDAPPermissions" setting must be set to true within the project detail settings for "ContentReaderEnumerators".

Authorizations are specified for each group, and the categories of authorizations may vary based on the installed modules. For instance, the MOBIDI Connector application module adds categories related to MOBIDI Office. Authorizations are granted to groups, and the permissions of users are automatically updated when they are added to or removed from groups. If no selection is made for any group, it is interpreted as having no authorization, which unlocks the authorization button.

Users in GEODI can originate from the LDAP/AD side or be defined as GEODI users. Management of LDAP-side users is handled on the AD side, and changes made on the AD side, such as email or password updates, may take 10-30 minutes to reflect in GEODI, during which the old information remains valid. Invitation emails can be sent to newly added users if their email address is defined. Users who have forgotten their password can request a new one from the login page.

If the license permits, open GEODI projects can be created using a guest user definition. Guest users are a practical solution for informational projects, exemplified by the Ankara digital city archive or the Nigerian Ministry of Treasury projects. To activate guest users, they must be enabled in Settings, assigned to a group, and given appropriate project authorizations. Guest users will appear as "guest" in the user list.

GEODI can integrate with authentication sources such as Google and Facebook, allowing users to log in using these services. Ready definitions are available for Google, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Microsoft. These definitions are located in a specific directory, and their extensions must be changed to "jSettings" for activation. Activated resources will appear on the login page. Users from these external sources must be authorized separately by including them in a group. Typing "*" in the user field and selecting Google will authorize all users from the Google resource, while replacing "*" with a user's email address will authorize only that specific user.

The GEODI infrastructure is compatible with external user authentication services beyond LDAP. It can integrate with other platforms used by organizations, requiring the services specified on Developers.decesoftware.com. Additionally, GEODI can integrate with user authentication features of services like Facebook and Google.

Project-specific permissions are defined within GEODI. If no permission is granted to any group for a project, all users will have access to all permissions. These permissions include "Can View Project" to specify which groups can view it, "Can Edit Project" to grant modification rights, "Can Index Project" for scanning authority, and "Can Delete Project" which makes the delete button visible. Other permissions are "Can Generate Reports" for exporting reports and "Data Operator" for labeling and grouping results from modules like FacePro and TextPro.

Resource-based authorizations can be configured within a project. If no permission is granted to any group for a data source, all users will have access to all permissions. These permissions include "Can Search" to control visibility of the resource, "Can Share" for sharing via the GEODI-defined Twitter account, and "Can View/Download" for accessing and downloading files. Additional permissions are "Can Add Notes" for adding notes to files and folders, "Can Edit Others' Notes" for modifying other users' notes, and "Can Add/Feed" for uploading files via the browser.

To view a logged-in user's permissions and clear the permission cache in GEODI, specific steps can be followed. Navigate to the "Api â†’ User Manager Api section". To view permissions, use "UserInfoFull" and "GetCurrentUserInfoWithPermissions()" then click "[RUN]". To clear the permission cache, use "Boolean" and "ClearCurrentUserPermissionCache()" then click "[RUN]"; this action immediately reflects changes in permissions.

By default, System Admins are privileged and have permission to view all content. This behavior can be overridden by setting a specific value to TRUE (default is FALSE) in the "SystemSettings" file, a setting that applies across all workspaces. Details for this configuration are available at https://support.decesoftware.com/space/DEV/1390184262/System+Configuration+-+Security+Settings. After overriding, individual permissions must be set for each data source. For example, a "DPO group" can be configured to open, report, and inspect all findings, while SystemAdmins cannot, assuming a source name like "SG-43". This process must be repeated for other sources. Initially, if all checkboxes are off, all permissions are on; however, once a checkbox is selected, permissions behave as expected, requiring individual assignment.
