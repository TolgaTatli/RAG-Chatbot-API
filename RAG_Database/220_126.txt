GEODI uses Modified Date instead of Creation Date. Modified Date is considered a more reliable value.

The Creation Date changes in situations such as copying.

The Modified Date indicates the usage date of a file, even if the file is old but still in use.

Modified Date is a more reliable option for operations like destruction or quarantine.
