After a discovery is completed, inspection of the results is necessary. GEODI offers multiple methods for inspection, including reports, panels, and predefined queries. This document provides details specifically about the predefined queries.

The `predefined:PCI` query is used to inspect results after a PCI/DSS discovery, identifying content and sources with PCI/DSS-related findings. This query covers findings related to credit cards, CVV, PIN, or Passwords. GEODI lists all relevant content, and a facet displays details about data sources and the number of findings. This provides initial insight into conforming and non-conforming sources, enabling users to take precautions such as deletion or quarantine actions, and to repeat the process until no findings are present on risky sources.

Queries influence reports and panels, allowing them to be used in conjunction with various reports for more detailed information.

The `predefined:PII` query is designed to find PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data, covering all rules related to PII in GDPR and other regulations. The details mentioned for `predefined:PCII` are also valid for this query. GEODI's recognizers are developed to handle country-specific situations and identify correct IDs, ensuring the `predefined:PII` query functions as expected across all countries and adapts itself to local rules and IDs.

For actions like deletion, quarantine, or masking of legacy data older than five years, predefined queries offer an easier method within GEODI. The `predefined:O5Y` query addresses legacy data older than five years by considering only content dates. Additionally, the `predefined:O10Y` query can be used to find data older than 10 years.

Inspection within GEODI requires permission, and GEODI provides several ways to inspect permissions. The `user:` query lists content that a specific user or group can access. System administrators also have the ability to check who can view a document by clicking on it.

GEODI offers several other predefined queries for specific content types. `predefined:Money` queries content containing various money types like $, Euro, Pound, or KSA riyal. `predefined:CreditCard` covers over 10 credit card types, including Test Cards. `predefined:DB` returns database content, encompassing SQL Server, Oracle, sqlite, and mdb types, which may be found in file servers or mail attachments. `predefined:Videos` queries video content, and `predefined:Images` queries image content. `predefined:Web` queries web content, including mails. `predefined:Maskcontent` identifies content that can be masked. `predefined:Local` queries content that is local, not originating from the web or GDE. `predefined:GDE` queries content fed by GDE. The queries `predefined:AbleToClassifyByLabel-` and `predefined:AbleToClassifyByADS` target content types that can be classified using Labelling/Tagging and ADS, and are recommended for use on panels, reports, and other relevant areas as labeling scope expands.
