GEODI Classifier possesses a flexible labeling mechanism designed for integration with DLP software or adaptation to existing labeling schemes. Labels are generated within the file for PDF, Office, and Libre Office documents, while for other file types, they are created as ADS (Alternate Data Stream). GEODI directly supports files that have been labeled using an existing classification tool and is compatible with their labeling schemes.

The labeling scheme and sample files are provided with standard templates. In these definitions, the initial label line is mandatory, with subsequent lines being optional. Users have the ability to modify existing definitions or introduce new ones. Classes are established as detailed on the GEODI Classifier Class and Policies determination page, and labels for these classes must adhere to a "name:value" format. At least one label must represent a class value and be a fixed value, though the "Value" itself can take various forms, such as "class:gizli" or "class:{58f30e89-66db-4092-a81f-282a2eee431c}".

Variables, such as username and date, can be incorporated within the "Value" field, and their names are case-sensitive. The specific variables available may differ based on the classification tool. These variables can include the computer username, the email sender for OWA, the GEODI user for bulk classification, the version information of the application where the class was assigned (e.g., Shell, Office add-in, or GEODI), date information in "yyyy-mm-dd" format, e-poch date values, and full UTC time information.

For users without an existing labeling scheme, GEODI Classification provides a set of default labels ready for use. These predefined labels are integrated into the system.

One of the default classes is "Gizli" (Secret), which includes the labels "geodilabelclass:id_classification_secret=2155a213-0150-4c2d-9211-dba2def647fd", "geodilabeluser:user=%User%", and "geodilabeltime:datetime=%Date-UTC%". This class is typically applied to content containing 50K USD or more, or its equivalent in money, along with specific keywords. These keywords are stored in a dictionary that users can customize.

Another default class is "Kişisel Veri" (Personal Data), associated with the labels "geodilabelclass:id_classification_personalinfo=d36d9a67-b760-4689-ad88-96381e595636", "geodilabeluser:user=%User%", and "geodilabeltime:datetime=%Date-UTC%". The definition of personal data is consistent across many regulations, generally encompassing a name or ID combined with information such as a phone number, email, address, or blood type. The ID definition is broad, covering National ID, Medical Record ID, passport numbers, and ID numbers from various countries added to a project.

The "Hizmete Özel" (Restricted) default class uses the labels "geodilabelclass:id_classification_restricted=3c9990e0-a748-41de-9d8c-db8783fa5103", "geodilabeluser:user=%User%", and "geodilabeltime:datetime=%Date-UTC%". This classification is applied to content containing terms like IBAN, Tax Numbers, Swift codes, and the phrase “hizmete özel”. The specific words used for this classification are located in a dictionary that can be modified by the user.

The "Tasnif Dışı" (Unclassified) default class is defined by the labels "geodilabelclass:id_classification_unclassified=0ef0d4bf-59b8-4ae6-bbc0-fafde041157b", "geodilabeluser:user=%User%", and "geodilabeltime:datetime=%Date-UTC%".

For the Defense Industry, a classification scheme that supports NATO and National Classification rules can be downloaded from DECE-STORE.
