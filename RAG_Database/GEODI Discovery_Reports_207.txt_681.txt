GEODI Discovery offers multiple reports, accessible by system administrators and members of the "ACC.Discovery" group. These reports are visible in workspaces only if specific settings exist within the GenericSettings in Workspace Advanced settings. GEODI Discovery includes four distinct reports, each designed to provide detailed information about findings. All reports, with the exception of the summary report, are available in Excel or CSV formats.

The Discovery:Summary Report provides an overview of findings from both structured and unstructured data. This report highlights information such as datasets containing sensitive data, identified findings, and details about table or column names. The discovery summary report includes multiple sub-reports and is provided in PDF format.

The Discovery:Content List report presents each line as a content or file with an associated risk value. Risks are calculated based on the risk score assigned to the source and the findings. This report covers various content types, including files, database rows, emails, and GDE-fed files, and content types can be limited using queries. Users should set a risk score between 0 and 100 for each source, with sources lacking a defined risk score assumed to have no risk. A content or file's risk score is determined by combining the source risk and the findings, where each finding has its own risk score; for instance, PII and PCI findings are considered high-risk, while a city name has a low-risk score.

The Discovery:Content Finding report details the number and type of findings discovered for each document. This report offers clear information regarding the compliance or non-compliance status of content.

The Discovery:Content Detail is the most comprehensive report available. It generates a CSV report where each row represents a unique discovery result, including details such as the source, content recognizer, version, and specific discovery results like Name, IBAN, or Currency. This report provides the most granular information about content; for example, if a file or content contains 100 credit card numbers and 100 identity information entries, the report will generate 200 rows. It is suggested to limit the source content by using queries when generating this report.
