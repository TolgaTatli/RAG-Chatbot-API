The GeoArchive module identifies Sheet Numbers, Coordinate Tables, Coordinate Values, and file boundaries within Structural and Non-Structural data. These capabilities enhance an archive's geographic quality and automate tasks that would otherwise require manual work with GIS software. To utilize this functionality, users need to add the recognizers included with the GeoArchive module to their project, with recognizer settings detailed in the project wizard help pages.

GeoArchive is also compatible with the licensed Parcel Recognizer and Mileage Recognizer. This integration enables the automatic association of plans, expropriation maps, road projects, and intersection projects, created using software like AutoCAD, Microstation, or Netcad, directly with GIS without requiring any pre-processing steps.

The Geographic Border Recognizer automatically identifies borders from geographic information found in existing CAD, GIS, and Spatial Databases. By using these recognized borders, users can automatically view plans, plan revisions, and various project sheets, along with the areas they encompass. GEODI's capabilities handle further processing, allowing the map to adapt based on search criteria. This recognizer also identifies Turkey Standard Sheet Numbers, with a default scale of 1/5000 and larger, which can be adjusted by the user.

For DWG, DXF, and DGN files, External Metadata must be defined. If not available for NCZ and DRE files, the same metadata file can be used. Shape files require a PRJ (Projection) file to be available; if it is not, the same metadata file can be utilized.

GEODI Users interested in training must have completed CAD&GIS User Training. The training covers topics such as an introduction to GeoArchive with a live example, the function of the Section Number Recognizer (if applicable) explained through a sample project, the role of the Milestone Identifier (if available) demonstrated with a sample project, an explanation of the Geographic Border Recognizer using a drone maps scenario, and the function of the Geographic Table Recognizer explained with sample data. Examples of Crosscutting Content are also included.

Training for GEODI Admins includes instruction on GeoArchive setup, Section Number Recognizer Setup, the creation of route dictionaries, Border Recognizer, Coordinate Table Recognizer, Layout Recognizer, and a Questions and Answers session.
