The Information and Communication Technologies Authority utilizes GEODI for its Data Discovery and Data Classification project. This project is undertaken to ensure GDPR compliance and Data Protection.

GEODI Semantic Discovery Tools are designed to scan millions of documents from various sources, including file folders, databases, PCs, and E-Mails. GEODI automatically classifies these documents using pre-set rules based on Semantic Discovery, and all remediation policies are developed in accordance with the discovery results.

With GEODI's search and insight capabilities, Data Protection Officers (DPOs) can quickly access and report documents containing critical and sensitive data within seconds.

Key capabilities include Search, Discover, Mask, Encrypt, and Classify. The stated mission is to protect data.
