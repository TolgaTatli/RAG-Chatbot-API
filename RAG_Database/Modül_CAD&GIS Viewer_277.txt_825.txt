The CAD&GIS Viewer module provides viewing and search support for various files, along with numerous additional features. Users can take notes directly on the viewer, for instance, to mark erroneous areas within an architectural project or plan. This viewer also facilitates the creation of a shared workspace for projects, enabling multiple stakeholders to collaborate on the same project.

GEODI's automatic versioning feature allows users to monitor changes in projects, easily providing information such as who made a change and how many times it was altered. If backup is enabled, GEODI can display older versions of CAD documents, including NCZ, DWG, and DGN files, and perform comparisons between old and new versions. The system also supports comparing versions of different files, such as the difference between two satellite images or a satellite image and a plan.

With the CAD&GIS Viewer, files do not need to be downloaded to a local environment, as all information resides on the server and can be viewed, including on mobile devices, based on user permissions. Textual information within supported file formats, such as Shape attributes or Netcad texts, becomes searchable. For formats or applications that lack direct projection, GEODI's metadata capabilities can be used to define them.

No additional license or local software is required for viewing; a standard browser is sufficient on any platform, including mobile devices. The supported file types include AutoCAD (DWG, DXF), Netcad (NCZ, CKS, KTB), Microstation (DGN), SHP, KML, ECW, SID, IMG, and GeoTIFF.

Training content for GEODI Users covers topics such as identifying file types and examples, using viewers, taking and navigating to notes, and versioning, including querying and comparing old and new versions. It also includes working with geographic files, such as identifying intersections and retrieving related files.

Training content for GEODI Administrators includes installation procedures and details on CAD and GIS files, specifying that DWG is for AutoCAD, NCZ for Netcad, DGN for Microstation, KML for Google Earth and all GIS software, GeoTIFF + ECW + MrSID for all GIS software, and Shape for all GIS software. This section also covers viewers, emphasizing that no extra software is required, and discusses features like intersections/neighbors in viewers, comparison capabilities, and note-taking.

Further topics for GEODI Administrators include handling large files and strip maps, understanding the purpose and method of defining projection for DWG and other formats, and details on supported formats. It also covers necessary Shape file projection information and the importance of projection for the Boundary Recognizer (GeoArchive feature). Additionally, the training addresses publishing content as WMS, specifying which content types GEODI publishes and important considerations such as tokens and correct projection selection. A section for Questions and Answers is also provided.
