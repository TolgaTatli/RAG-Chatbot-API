GEODI project or index backup and synchronization can stem from various needs. Backing up the index against potential losses is crucial because indexing all data takes a long time, and restoring from a backup ensures a more uninterrupted service. GEODI can quickly complete the difference between a backup and the current index due to its ability to index changing content. Daily backup is recommended, and GEODI installation is pre-configured for this, requiring only activation. If an Active-Passive disaster recovery configuration is established, an index copy is necessary for quick transition, and the backup procedure remains the same.

For periodic index backup, the GEODI index is located at `%appdata%\dece\geodi\GeodiIndex2.0`. The files in this directory are in continuous use, so backup must be performed using the command found in the GEODI script reference. GEODI safely backs up the index to the specified directory while running. It is important to note that any notes taken or documents added via drag-and-drop after the last backup will be lost. Backup can be made periodic using the Windows scheduled task infrastructure. GeodiWS Project files and other settings must also be synchronized separately.

GEODI commands are found in DCC-extended files, which can be called within Batch or PowerShell. An example command for backup is `d.BackupIndex("[Yedeklenecek Hedef Dizin]","[WorkSpace adÄ±]")`. The target directory and Workspace name must be adjusted, and if there are multiple Workspaces, each must be handled separately. Scheduled tasks can be created using Windows Task Scheduler or another preferred method. When creating a task from the scheduler, the "Run with highest privileges" option should be activated to avoid authorization issues.

GEODI can repair a damaged index or use one from a backup. Repair can be a lengthy process and may fail depending on the extent of the damage, in which case restarting indexing is the only remaining option. Therefore, restoring from backup (RestoreBackup) should be the primary choice. The GEODI Project Wizard's last page, under advanced settings, offers three different options within the "Recovery Options" tab.

The "Default" recovery option automatically initiates a repair when GEODI reopens and detects a corrupted index, accompanied by a warning. The repair status can be monitored on the Project Management page. During this process, search and classification operations continue in other projects. Feeding operations via GDE are automatically suspended, with GDE checking every two hours. An "Index is being corrected" warning will be displayed in the ES interface for the project undergoing repair.

The "RestoreBackup" recovery option requires specifying the directory used for backup. This option utilizes backups taken with the previously described method. If the specified backup directory is empty or inaccessible, the process will automatically revert to the "Default" option.

The "DoNothing" recovery option performs no repair or restoration from backup, requiring the index to be manually corrected. Depending on the index damage, it may be possible to continue with search and other operations, but correction is mandatory. The ES interface will indicate that the index is corrupted.
