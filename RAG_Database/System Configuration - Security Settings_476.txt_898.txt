Configuration settings for GEODI can be edited by creating a SystemSettings.json file located next to GEODI.exe. Users can begin with a sample JSON found in SystemSettings.ReadMe.txt. By default, GEODI does not permit REST API calls from other domains, but allowed domains can be defined within SystemSettings.json. It is important that JSON content does not include any comments. The settings file is read only once, requiring a restart of GEODI.exe or the IIS Pool if any setting is modified.

The `AppDataFolder` setting, a string with a default null value in the System category, specifies the path used by the application for Project, Log, Default Index, Dictionaries, and all metadata. If the value is null or empty, the AppData location is used. For IIS, a common path for GEODI.exe and GEODI can be specified, where `%App%` indicates the application folder. `System.Environment.SpecialFolder` values can be used within path definitions enclosed in `%%`. To ensure compatibility with GEODI.exe, the folder name should be retrieved by typing `%appdata%` in the Windows explorer address bar. An example configuration is `{"AppDataFolder":"C:\\GeodiDataFolder"}`.

The `AppPort` setting, an integer with a default value of 3323 in the WebServer category, determines the port used by the Web Server initiated via GEODI.exe. If this setting is configured to 80, it eliminates the need to specify ports on the client-side. Similarly, if the `SSLCertificate` setting is configured and the 443 SSL port is utilized, client-side port specification is also unnecessary. The "Port" key can also be passed as an executable parameter.

The `AppIP` setting, a string with a default null value in the WebServer category, available from version 7.0.1.25977+, is used to specify the IP address that the WebServer, initiated via the executable, will listen on. By default, the server broadcasts on all available IP addresses. The "IP" key can also be utilized as an executable parameter.

The `ModuleStoreFolder` setting, a string with a default null value in the System category, is used to store `*.GeodiModuleX` files for offline automatic module updates. If this setting is not configured, GEODI will utilize DECE-STORE for updates.

The `SocketReceiveTimeout` and `SocketHeaderReceiveTimeout` settings are both integers with a default value of -1 in the WebServer category. `SocketReceiveTimeout` defines the default connection timeout for the application in milliseconds. `SocketHeaderReceiveTimeout` specifies the default timeout for the application to read headers, also in milliseconds.

The `TrustedRefererSiteList` setting, a string array with a default null value in the WebServerSecurity category, is used to define sites that are trusted for providing links to the system, and for Iframe and Rest API access. This setting accepts `*` as a wildcard. Its purpose is to prevent misleading requests from users through standard browsers. By default, all sites are allowed.

The `TrustedOriginSiteList` setting, a string array with a default null value in the WebServerSecurity category, uses POST Data to determine which sites are trusted for Iframe and Rest API access. This setting also accepts `*` as a wildcard. It aims to prevent misleading requests from users through standard browsers. By default, no sites are allowed. An example configuration is `{"TrustedOriginSiteList":["*"]}`.

The `TrustedOriginUICheck` setting, a boolean with a default value of true in the WebServerSecurity category, available from version 7.0.1.26096+, controls access based on origin and tokens. If set to false, origin and token access control is performed exclusively for REST API requests. If set to true, no content other than the `gui / public / folder` will be served to sites that are not included in the `TrustedOriginSiteList` and do not access with tokens.

The `DisableCSRFSecurity` setting, a boolean with a default value of false in the WebServerSecurity category, is used to disable custom additional security settings for the Webserver. This setting aims to prevent misleading requests from users through standard browsers. Disabling it provides a relatively minor performance increase, less than 0.01%, and it is recommended not to turn off this setting.

The `XSSSecurityMode` setting, an integer with a default value of 0 in the WebServerSecurity category, available from version 8.0.0.27386+, is used to configure the behavior for HTML content found in form and querystring values within incoming requests. This setting does not add an HTTP header; the `HttpHeaders` setting should be used for that purpose. When set to 0 (Default), only required fields are preserved, which is a high-performance and safe usage. Other options can be temporarily employed if an unexpected detection occurs. A value of 1 (ToSafeHTML) permits only basic HTML uses, such as `b`, `i`, `h1`, for all incoming fields in requests, which significantly reduces performance. A value of 2 (ClearHTML) clears all incoming HTML tags in requests, also greatly reducing performance.

For `XSSSecurityMode` options 3 through 6, GEODI version 8.0.0.27658+ is required. Option 3 (ThrowErrorHasHTML) causes an error to be thrown if HTML is present in the request. Option 4 (SmartMode_ToSafeHtml) performs safe HTML conversion only for required fields, functioning similarly to the Default option. Option 5 (SmartMode_ClearHTML) clears HTML expressions exclusively for required fields. Option 6 (SmartMode_ThrowErrorHasHTML) throws an error if HTML values are sent in fields that necessitate control.

The `HttpHeaders` setting, a string array with a default null value in the WebServerSecurity category, allows for the definition of header information to be sent to the client in `HTTP_HEADER:VALUE` format. This setting can be utilized to configure browser-side security settings based on API usage. A sample configuration is `HttpHeaders: ["X-XSS-Protection:1", "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff"]`.

The `ShowWebExceptionStackTrace` setting, a boolean with a default value of false in the WebServerSecurity category, allows for the display of error details in the event of Web request errors. By default, these details are not displayed. The `LogExceptionStackTrace` setting, a boolean with a default value of false in the System category, permits the logging of additional details for Scan and System startup errors.

The `ServerNames` setting, a string array with a default null value in the WebServerSecurity category, provides server name information for the WebServer started via GEODI.exe. When this setting is defined, subdomain usage is blocked; for instance, if `servername` is set to `myserver`, requests to `sub.myserver` will not be accepted. An example configuration is `{"ServerNames": ["localhost","127.0.0.1","www.myserver.com","myserver.com"]}`.

The `EnableUrlSession` setting, a boolean with a default value of false in the WebServerSecurity category, allows session transfer via URL if enabled. This is a configuration setting that is not recommended for use.

The `TileExpandPercent` setting, a double with a default value of 20.0 in the WMSServer category, represents the default tile enlargement ratio used for labels on the WMS Server.

The `VerisonExtenderText` setting, a string with a default null value in the System category, is used to modify the version code specified for content delivered to the browser. This can be utilized to reset the browser cache when a theme is being prepared.

The `UseDefaultCredential` setting, a boolean with a default value of true in the System category, forces the use of system proxy settings for remote connections, such as those involved in web site crawling.

The `ServerUri` setting, a string with a default null value in the Notification category, is used to specify the web address that will be used in links generated by background services, such as email sending.

The `AutoRecovery` setting, a boolean with a default value of false in the System category, automatically corrects faulty entries without approval in cases of power failure or disk failure. The `AutoIndexUpdate` setting, a boolean with a default value of false in the System category, allows the GEODI version to update Indexes without approval if necessary. The `AutoIndexUpdateAndRecovery` setting, a boolean with a default value of false in the System category, available from GEODI 7.0.1.26858+, is not required for use under Service or IIS. This setting automatically corrects faulty entries in cases of power failure or disk failure without approval, and also updates GEODI version Indexes without approval if needed.

The `IgnoreSystemAdminContentAccessPrivileges` setting, a boolean with a default value of false in the WebServerSecurity category, available from version 8.0.027625+, cancels the privileges of viewing, opening, and downloading content for the "System Administrator" authority if set to true. These capabilities are expected to be authorized even for a "System Administrator." This setting can be managed on a project basis using `Settings.SystemAdminMode` within the GEODI application.

The `DisableBasicAuthentication` setting, a boolean with a default value of false in the WebServerSecurity category, turns off Basic Authentication support. All Authentication services on GEODI are protected against automated trial attacks.

The `SecurityProtocolForRequest` setting, an integer with a default value of 3120 in the System category, available from GEODI 7.0.1.26674+ and MOBIDIOfis 5.0.0.13115+, is used to set the security protocol for HTTP calls made to different servers. Defined values include SSL 2 (12), SSL 3 (48), TLS 1.0 (192), TLS 1.1 (768), TLS 1.2 (3072), and TLS 1.3 (12288). The default value of 3120 corresponds to TLS1.2 + SSL 3.

The `SecurityProtocolForResponse` setting, an integer with a default value of 16368 in the WebServerSecurity category, available from GEODI 7.0.1.26674+ and MOBIDIOfis 5.0.0.13106+, is used to specify which security protocols are supported if SSL settings are configured in the document. Defined values include SSL 2 (12), SSL 3 (48), TLS 1.0 (192), TLS 1.1 (768), TLS 1.2 (3072), and TLS 1.3 (12288). The default value of 16368 represents an inclusive value that supports legacy clients, encompassing TLS 1.0 + TLS 1.1 + TLS1.2 + TLS 1.3 + SSL 3. A value of 15408 represents TLS1.2 + TLS 1.3 + SSL 3, which compels clients to use secure communication.

The `SSLLocalCertificateSerial` setting, a string with a default null value in the WebServer category, available from version 6.1.0.24659+, is used to activate SSL with a valid certificate installed under Computer Certificates / Personal. An alternative method is to specify a certificate file using the `SSLCertificate` setting. This method is generally preferred for SSL definition as it does not require a password. The value for this setting can be found in the Details→Serial number section of the certificate window in Windows. For CSR (Certificate Signing Request) for SSL certificate supply, `csrgenerator.com` or `digicert.com/easy-csr/openssl.htm` can be used, or it can be obtained via IIS before stopping IIS. If GEODI is run over IIS, this setting is not used, and IIS definitions are applied instead. If `AppPort` is set to 443, there is no need to write ports on the client-side.

The `SSLCertificate` setting, a string with a default null value in the WebServer category, is used to specify the location of the SSL certificate file. If this setting is defined, GEODI.exe will only return HTTPS requests. Supported file extensions include `.cer`, `.p7b`, and `.pfx`. This method should generally not be used, with the `SSLLocalCertificateSerial` setting being preferred. If `AppPort` is set to 443, there is no need to write ports on the client-side.

The `SSLCertificatePass` setting, a string with a default null value in the WebServer category, is used to specify the password for the SSL Certificate file if it is utilized. The password can be provided as open text or as non-portable crypto using GEODI tools. This method should generally not be used, with the `SSLLocalCertificateSerial` setting being preferred.

The `SSLErrorLog` setting, a boolean with a default value of false in the WebServer category, available from version 6.1.0.24659+, logs all SSL validation errors if set to true.

The `NoSSLPort` setting, an integer with a default value of 0 in the WebServer category, available from version 6.1.0.21550+, specifies that if SSL is configured and a port other than 0 is provided, the HTTP service will be delivered from this protocol. The `ForceHttpsRedirect` setting, a boolean with a default value of false in the WebServer category, also available from version 6.1.0.21550+, ensures that all HTTP requests are forwarded to the HTTPS address if `NoSSLPort` is set.

The `AutoForwardedURL` setting, a string with a default null value in the WebServer category, available from version 6.1.0.23511+, is used to specify the server address when routing header information containing "X-Forwarded-For" is received. Penetration safety measures may interfere with such orientations. If a DMZ Proxy or IIS Rewrite Proxy is used for cross-network or port forwarding, the `TrustedRefererSiteList` and `TrustedOriginSiteList` settings in `SystemSettings.json` must be modified to accept the address displayed in the browser. The address shown in the browser should be written at the `AutoForwardedURL`. The "AutoForwardedURL" key can also be passed as an executable parameter. An example configuration is `{"TrustedRefererSiteList":["*.mypublicwebsite.com*"], "TrustedOriginSiteList":["*.mypublicwebsite.com*"], "AutoForwardedURL":"http://www.mypublicwebsite.com"}`.

The `SystemTray` setting, a boolean with a default value of true in the WindowsGUI category, available from version 5.3.0.16891+, controls the display of GEODI.exe. If true, GEODI.exe opens as an icon in the Windows Notification Area instead of opening on the left, and Windows will not offer form interfaces, allowing process management via right-click menus. If false, GEODI.exe is located on the left, and this setting requires IE9+ compatibility.

The `Theme` setting, a string with a default value of "Square" in the GUI category, available from version 6.0.0.18338+, defines the default theme. Folder names located under `GUI/Theme` can be used for this setting.

The `Language` setting, a string with a default value of "Kurulum Dili" in the System category, available from version 6.0.0.18398+, specifies the default language. The language code must be written, and if not set, the installation language is used. The "Language" key can also be passed as an executable parameter.

The `LogMode` setting, an integer with a default value of 0 in the System category, available from version 6.1.0.21152+, is used to determine the information to be logged. Logging is not performed by default. This setting functions as a flag, and logs are stored under `Appdata / Logs / [APP] / DebugLog`. A value of 0 means no logs. A value of 1 (SQL) enables logging of all database queries run by the application. A value of 2 (UserData) logs information about users connected to the system. A value of 4 (Request) logs all HTTP requests. A value of 8 (Request Detail) logs all HTTP requests with full detail. A value of 16 (CreateHttpRequest), which requires version 7.0.1.26660+, logs web requests and addresses to external servers.

The `SessionTimeout` setting, an integer with a default value of 120 in the System category, available from version 6.1.0.21152+, defines the maximum allowed inactivity time for a user before the automatic log out process begins.

The `DefaultWS` setting, a string with a default value of "My Computer" in the System category, available from version 6.1.0.25423+, is the default project name in the GEODI ES / DA interface. It is used if the URL does not contain a `wsName` or if no project is remembered for the current user.

The `LoginProviders` setting, a string array with a default null value in the System category, available from version 7.0.0.25611, is used to limit the `LoginProvider` definitions that can be used to log into the system. By default, login with all recognized providers is allowed. For example, if `["LDAP"]` is specified, it is not possible to log in with Geodi users; only login with LDAP users is permitted.

The `ClientProtectionKey1` and `ClientProtectionKey2` settings, both strings with a default null value in the WebServerSecurity category, available from version 6.1.0.25423+, relate to user internal token crypto changes for each server. The entropy for encryption can be increased or decreased using the values provided in these settings.

The `MaxUrlSize` setting, an integer with a default value of 2048 in the WebServer category, available from version 7.0.001.25764+, is used to determine the maximum URL size. There is no limit for requests made using the POST method.

It is important to note that if an IIS-like Web server is used instead of GEODI.exe, the properties categorized under `WebServer` are not utilized. However, the settings within the `WebServerSecurity` category continue to be applied.
