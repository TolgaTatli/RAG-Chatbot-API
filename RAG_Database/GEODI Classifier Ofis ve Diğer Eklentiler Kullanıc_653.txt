GEODI Classifier is the common name for a set of tools used for manual or automatic classification of data. It includes add-ons for Microsoft Office, Exchange Server, Office 365, and Windows. Classifier solutions are compatible with DLP solutions such as ForcePoint, Symantec, and TrendMicro.

Add-ons for GEODI Classifier will not activate without the installation of GEODI and GEODI Classifier licenses. After the GEODI Classifier Windows Client and Desktop Add-on installation, a "sınıfla" (classify) option appears on the Windows right-click menu. The options presented via "sınıfla" may vary based on server settings. This method creates tags for formats with tag support, such as Office documents and PDFs, which will be interpreted by DLP solutions. For file types without tag support, tags are written using a feature of the NTFS file system, which is also compatible with DLP solutions.

With the installation of Microsoft Office Add-ons, a menu is added to the "Giriş" (Home) tab in Microsoft Office applications, supporting Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Outlook. For compatible versions, users should refer to the system requirements document. The options presented may vary depending on server settings, allowing users to manually or automatically select the document's class. The chosen class determines which tags are written, whether a watermark will be present, and its appearance, all based on settings. Classification options are re-prompted when saving the document or exporting to PDF, and it may not be possible to save without selecting a class, depending on settings.

Automatic classification in GEODI is built upon GEODI's discovery capabilities. The rules for how each class is formed can be defined in the server settings. In addition to classes like "Gizli/Özel" (Confidential/Private), distinctions such as "içinde kişisel veri var/yok" (contains personal data/does not contain personal data) can also be created.

The classification tool attempts to place class values and watermarks in the most appropriate location within Word documents. The specific values written depend on definitions. Header, Footer, and Watermark values can be made visible and aligned to the right, left, or center, though not all are required. Word, Excel, and Powerpoint are capable software offering numerous layout, font, and size options. In some cases, it may not be possible to write class values without affecting the document; users are advised to try the provided options or modify their templates to account for classification values. Situations encountered with manually created headers/footers also apply to GEODI tags, such as a footer not displaying in some Office versions when printing a vertically formatted page horizontally. If document margins are used to their fullest extent, GEODI class tags will inevitably conflict with existing content, requiring space to be allocated for the tag.

During offline operation, if the computer cannot access the GEODI server, only manual classification can be performed using the classification tools. Log records of classifications made during this time will be transferred to the server upon the first connection. Classification tools search for servers during offline connection, which may result in slightly longer opening times. In such a situation, users should contact their company's IT department for a solution.

When the classes and classification policies used are changed on the GEODI server, these changes will take effect during the next use.
