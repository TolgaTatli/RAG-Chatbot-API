GEODI maintains numerous logs concerning user activities and its own operations. These logs offer multiple benefits, including monitoring activities, analysis with tools like SIEM, and identifying and resolving errors. GEODI Logs are utilized for tracking operations such as security, system errors, and system changes. The provided text contains detailed explanations of GEODI's recorded logs, which can enhance the interpretation of information from SIEMs. Additionally, a few summary reports generated by GEODI from these logs are described on the same page.

Information regarding Classification Logs (Sınıflama Logları) is available, along with the GEODI Classifier Log Analysis Panel and Log formats. Usage Logs (Kullanım Logları) are also maintained by GEODI.

Usage logs record the activities of users and system administrators within GEODI interfaces. Each operation is represented as a single row, detailing the time of the operation, the individual who performed it, and specific information related to the operation. These logs are stored in CSV format.

Usage logs capture various data points for each operation. These include the license owner's email (E-mail), the time of the last operation (Date), the GEODI License Number (Session), and the application type (AppType), which is GS for GEODI Server. User-specific information such as the user who performed the operation (UserInfo), the user's language (Language), and the user's computer's IP address (IP) are also recorded. System-related metrics include the user's total time in the system (TickCount), the name of the project where the operation occurred (WS), and the user's action (Action), with further details available in a subsequent table. The Mode field indicates if an event is Atomic (instantaneous) or if it has a start/end, specified in separate rows. Additional fields like Info and Detail can vary based on the Action field, with their details also found in a subsequent table. Memory usage is tracked via Process Memory(Kb), which is the memory used when the log was written, and Process Max Memory(Kb), representing the peak memory usage reached.

GEODI logs various actions, including Application(Start/End) for GEODI's startup and shutdown, with server information provided in the Detail field. Login (Atomic) actions are logged for user entry, where Info and Detail values can be "RestAPI" for login page entries or "RememberMe" for "Remember Me" entries, and Detail includes the IP address. Logout(Atomic) actions are recorded, with Info indicating "Timeout" for session timeouts or "RestApi" when the user manually closes the session. UnSuccessfulLogin(Atomic) for failed logins has an Info value of "RestAPI". ForgotPassword actions are logged with an Info value of "RestAPI" and a Detail field indicating the email address where password reset information was sent.

Actions related to user and group management are logged. CreateOrUpdateUser records the creation or updating of a new user in User Management, with Info and Detail values typically "RestAPI" and Detail indicating "OK_Created" or "OK_Updated". UserGroupUpdated logs user editing, group changing, adding to a group, permission changes, new group creation, and group editing. The Info field for UserGroupUpdated includes the names of created, added, or edited groups, and edited user names. The Detail field for user editing, group changing, adding to a group, new group creation, and group editing situations is "Perms: - Users:", while for permission changes, it is "Perms:+DECE.SYSTEMMANAGER - Users".

GEODI logs actions within its Manager interface and related to project configuration. These include accessing the Manager/Settings page (SettingsPage(Atomic)) and the Manager/Projects page (ProjectPage(Atomic)). ProjectEdit(Start/End) is logged when an existing project is edited within the Project Wizard. LayerUse(Atomic) records when a layer is used, edited, or removed in the Project Wizard, with Info providing an example recognizer like "Recognizer:geometryRecognizerName". EnumeratorUse(Atomic) logs when a source, such as "Documents" or "e-Mail", is used in the Project Wizard, with the source name in the Info field. SCAN(Start/End) is logged when indexing begins in a project from Manager/Projects, and other scanning options on the Manager screen are also logged.

Actions related to various GEODI interfaces and queries are logged. These include accessing the Manager/Dictionaries page (DictionaryPage(Atomic)) and editing dictionaries (DictionaryEdit(Start/End)). When the GEODI Home page is opened, QueryPage(Atomic) is logged. All queries made in the GEODI Contents tab are logged as Query_DLV(Start/End), with the query string in Detail, e.g., "doc:*.pdf". Transitions to the GEODI Map tab are logged as MAP(Atomic), and clicks on the GEODI map are logged as QueryResultFromGeodiMap(Atomic). Transitions to the GEODI Calendar tab are logged as CUSTOM_WS_CALENDAR(Atomic), and all queries within this tab are VIEW_CALENDAR (Start/End), with the query string in Detail. Queries in the GEODI Words tab are logged as QUERY_KLV(Start/End), also with the query string in Detail. Transitions to the GEODI Explorer Screen are VIEW_EXPLORER (Start/End), with the query string in Detail. Opening the GEODI MediaMon panel is logged as CUSTOM_WS_m_DashBoardMediaMonitor(Atomic), and transitions to the GEODI Graph tab are CUSTOM_WS_DGRAPH(Atomic). All queries made in the GEODI Graph tab, including VIEW_DGRAPH_KW-DOC, VIEW_DGRAPH_DOC-KW, and VIEW_DGRAPH_KW-KW, are logged as Start/End events with the query string in Detail. When the GEODI Content Viewer is opened, ContentViewer(Atomic) is logged, with the UNCPath of the opened document in Info, such as "c:\beyza_sınıflama\deneme.docx".

Actions related to document annotation are logged. These include LabelAdd (Atomic) for adding notes to documents, LabelEdit (Atomic) for editing notes, and LabelRemove (Atomic) for deleting notes. For these actions, the Info field contains the UNCPath of the document where the note was added, edited, or deleted, for example, "c:\beyza_sınıflama\deneme.docx".

GEODI records errors that occur during its operation in Error Logs. AppError logs contain explanations of server-side errors within GEODI. EngineError logs capture errors and explanations encountered by GEODI during scanning, such as inaccessible websites, faulty PDFs, or encrypted files. Both AppError and EngineError logs are located in specific directories.

Windows generates separate logs when GEODI and its components are running.

The GEODI Manager/Projects Page offers various reports for each project, including a System report. This report provides general information about server settings, encompassing application settings, server information, modules, and projects. For each project, the report details project information, resources, layers, project permissions, and resource permissions.

The Doc/Layer Report is a specific report that provides the content count based on layers. This report includes the Project Name (WS NAME), the Layers involved, and the count of content found within the relevant layer in the project.
