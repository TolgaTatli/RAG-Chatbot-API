GEODI operates under the motto "Ara-Keşfet-Sınıfla-Maskele." While data discovery is commonly associated with regulations such as KVKK or PCI/DSS, GEODI's capabilities extend beyond the data discovery requirements for these regulations.

GEODI's data discovery capabilities are crucial for revealing relationships between individuals, dates, and locations, which is vital information across various professions and tasks. With GEODI tools, users can easily perform analyses such as identifying documents where two people appear together, determining who is in the same photograph, finding place names associated with a specific person, or discovering people, places, or dates related to a particular word.

GEODI's tools are beneficial for a wide range of professionals, including lawyers, press consultants, independent auditors, inspectors, experts, managers, and those involved in Digital Forensics. These tools are designed for simple use and deliver effective results. The functionalities described are applicable to all entities discovered by GEODI's data discovery tools, not exclusively to person names, places, or dates.

GEODI's discovery tools identify various entities within data, including names, place names, addresses, TCNO, credit card numbers, company names, and other user-defined assets. These recognized entities serve as a summary of the content and are termed "kelime" (word) within GEODI. A relationship can be established if two individuals appear in the same document. While person names appearing in widely separated parts of a document may not indicate a relationship, their close proximity within the same document can signify one. Furthermore, if the same name is found across different documents, those documents can be considered related.

GEODI supports over 200 data sources, ensuring comprehensive coverage of digital data, including scanned documents processed via OCR. The system can process various file types such as databases, Word, Excel, Open Office files, emails, UYAP files, videos, and images. This allows GEODI to process documents like invoices, reports, proposal files, project files, specifications, and contracts without requiring any prior manipulation. Users can also add new data sources that are not explicitly listed.

When searching for two names in GEODI, results initially include all content where both names are present, irrespective of their proximity within the document. To address this, GEODI offers a special proximity search operator. By using this operator, users can specify a maximum word distance between the names, such as requiring them to be within 10 words of each other. If the default 10-word distance, which is based on average paragraph size, is not suitable, users can define a different proximity value.

The rule for determining the proximity between a name and a place name in GEODI is the same as for two names. Users can simply type the name and place name to initiate a search. GEODI supports various writing styles, including the use of an asterisk (*) to encompass variations like "Ispartalı" or "Ispartada," and a tilde (~) to account for misspelled terms.

GEODI queries allow for the simultaneous application of multiple rules and criteria. For instance, a query can be constructed to find content where two names are in close proximity and the word "economy" is also present. Users can add an unlimited number of criteria to their searches. GEODI's semantic features enable it to accurately identify dates, regardless of their language, format, or alphabet, allowing for queries that include specific date ranges, such as content containing "economy" and dates between January and March.

GEODI queries offer more than just listing content, extending beyond the "Contents" tab used for proximity searches of names or names and place names. For this purpose, GEODI provides various view options, including Words, Calendar, Network Graph, and Map, which offer additional information.

The "Words" page in GEODI lists names, dates, and other information that are in close proximity to the entities specified in a query. Users can filter results to display only nearby dates by selecting "dates" in the facet area, or choose both "dates" and "places." If no selection is made, all discovered words are displayed. This page also supports querying the proximity to a single entity, such as a name, which will then show related dates and other information. Such single-entity queries influence the Map, Calendar, and Network Graph views, but do not affect the Contents view.

The "Calendar" page in GEODI is automatically generated from date information found within texts. When a query is executed, it displays dates from the matching content. For example, a query for "economy" will show all dates from documents containing the word "economy," whereas a proximity query like "economy()" will narrow the results to only dates close to the word "economy." Dates listed on the "Words" page are presented in a calendar format, which also indicates the frequency of dates over time. Users can click on a specific date within the calendar to access the corresponding document.

In GEODI, certain words possess associated coordinates, which can include parcels, place names, or phone numbers with area codes; these are collectively referred to as "Location." On the Map page, entering a term like "economy" will display locations found in documents containing that word. Using a proximity query, such as "economy()", will show locations that are close to the word "economy." This functionality allows users to understand, for example, which provinces prominently feature "economy" in news, or to visualize drilling locations from a construction firm's archive using "sondaj()", or to view subdivision-related parcels in municipal documents with "ifraz()".

The "Network Graph" page is an integral component of the GEODI Discovery Module. This feature provides a visual representation of relationships, including word-to-word, word-to-document, and document-to-word connections.

The GEODI FacePro application is capable of recognizing faces within photographs and videos. This functionality allows users to perform queries, such as identifying individuals who appear in the same photograph, by utilizing the previously described search methods.
