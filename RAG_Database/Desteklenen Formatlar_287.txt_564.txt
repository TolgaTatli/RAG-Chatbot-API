Additional supported formats include TXT, XML, MPP (Microsoft Project Manager), UDF (Uyap Doküman Formatı), EYP (E-Yazışma Paketi), and MOBIDI (MOBIDI Ofis).

GEODI URL is a proprietary format designed for GEODI, which enables the mapping of a website to a specific geographic location, such as a point, line, or area. This can be utilized for purposes like defining a walking route, a camping area, or a particular point within a factory. It is important to note that GEODI does not index the website itself via GEODI URL; a separate web source must be defined for website indexing.

The GEODI URL file structure includes fields such as 'url=' for the web address, 'Türkçe=' and 'English=' for descriptions in different languages. The 'Geom=' field allows for entering geometry in WKT format using the WGS84 datum, with examples like POINT(33 42) or LINESTRING (30 10, 10 30, 40 40). The 'geomdisplayname=' field is used to define the label for the geometry on a map. An external link for WKT information is provided at https://arthur-e.github.io/Wicket/sandbox-gmaps3.html.

GEODI allows for the definition of external metadata for files by creating a '.meta.xml' file in the same location as the main file. This method is used to define information not present within the file itself, such as assigning a projection to CAD files with unknown projections or associating values like a person or parcel. For example, a file named "Dünya Haritası.DWG" would have its metadata in "Dünya Haritası.DWG.meta.xml". This is one of several methods GEODI offers for defining structural data for content.

The structure and naming rules for meta files can be configured using a separate settings file, referred to as a 'jsettings' file, which enables support for various meta file formats. This definition file must be located in the [.\Settings\AttributeProvider\XMLMeta] directory. Any modifications to this file require GEODI to be restarted for the changes to take effect. An example configuration shows how *.meta.xml files can be associated with *.tif files.

The expected content structure for an XML meta file includes several key elements. 'TargetExtension' is an optional field that specifies the target file extension; if undefined, name matching is checked for all files. 'MainFileFormat' determines how name matching with files is controlled, using [FILE] for the filename and [EXT] for the extension. 'IgnoreMetaFile' is an optional field that, if left blank, results in the meta file also being indexed by GEODI. 'GroupElement' specifies the group node name on the XML.

Further elements in the XML meta file structure include 'KeyElement', an optional key node name under the group node, where a 'Projection' expression is always accepted as a projection, either in EPSG or WKT format. 'ValueElement' specifies the value node name under the group node. 'AreaElement' defines the area type value under the group node, determining its position in the index, which can be 'Header' or 'Content'. If 'Content' is used, the information is displayed in summaries, while 'Header' is the default value. Additionally, 'PreviewImage' allows forcing a base64 image for preview, 'Summary' can force a summary preview for searches, and 'ViewerUrl' can set the address for opening content.

The XML meta file structure also includes elements for access control. 'Permit' defines a list of authorized users, which can include user IDs, group IDs, or provider group ID lists. Information for active users can be retrieved from the /api address. Similarly, 'Deny' defines a list of forbidden users, also supporting user IDs, group IDs, or provider group ID lists, with active user information obtainable from the /api address.

An example of a meta XML file demonstrates how to define a projection for files lacking geographic reference, such as DWG files, requiring the DWG coordinates to be in the specified projection. This can be done by setting 'Projection' to an EPSG code like 'EPSG:4326' or by providing a WKT projection definition.

Another example illustrates how to add text content to files using the meta XML. This feature can be used to add descriptions to image or video files, and the defined content is appended to any existing text information. The 'AreaElement' for this content can be set to 'Header' or 'Content', where 'Content' ensures the text is visible in summaries, while 'Header' is the default. An example provided is 'Not' with the value 'Şu fotoğraftaki kedilerin güzelliğine bakar mısınız?' under 'Content'.

The meta XML file can also be used to add geometry to any content, specified under the 'GEOM' field with a WKT geometry definition. For permission-based content viewing, the meta XML works in conjunction with standard authorization, such as LDAP. If a file is forbidden to a user via LDAP, the meta.xml cannot override this restriction. The 'Permit' field lists authorized users, and the 'Deny' field lists forbidden users, both accepting user IDs, group IDs, or provider group IDs, with active user information available from the /api address.
