This page outlines the basic structure of GEODI Server, its plugins, and integrations, explaining the general structure, though not all mentioned features may be included in a user's license. GEODI can index numerous data sources and file types, including those on local networks, cloud servers, email servers, web pages, or social media services. A complete list of these can be found on the GEODI Data Sources and Supported Format pages. To access these sources, GEODI requires authorized users, tokens, or database connection information, which it stores encrypted to prevent decryption even if files are compromised. GEODI offers various capabilities with its content, such as Search, Discovery, Analysis, Classification, OCR, face recognition, and object recognition. Details for GEODI installation, configuration, and source definition are available on the GEODI Server Installation and Configuration page.

GEODI generates an index from the content it scans. This index contains details such as full-text search capabilities, semantic information, discovered insights, and document previews. The index is a critical component for GEODI and must be backed up. In a disaster scenario, GEODI can operate in active/active or active/passive modes and is compatible with load balancing tools like F5, Citrix, or TR7.

GEODI functions as a web application, capable of providing its services over both the internet and/or intranet.

Users of GEODI Enterprise Search can access the system using web browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Safari, or Firefox. The majority of GEODI's management interfaces are also web-based, allowing system administrators to access them similarly. Access can be restricted based on features and sources through detailed user authorization. GEODI's default port is 3323. If Port 80 is configured, clients do not need to specify the port. Similarly, if an SSLCertificate is set and Port 443 (SSL) is used, clients also do not need to specify the port. All details regarding these settings can be found on the System Configuration and Security Settings page.

The GEODI Classifier consists of several optional components, specifically the Desktop and Office Classifier and the OWA classifier. The distribution of the Desktop and Office Classifier can be managed using tools such as Manageengine or SCCM. Installation, configuration, and training content for the Classifier can be found on the Classification page.

GEODI's capabilities can be extended through its API, allowing for the connection of new data sources and integration with various other applications.
