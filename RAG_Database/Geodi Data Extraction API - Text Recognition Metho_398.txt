The token can be got by generating a GEODI Token.

The "Recognize" operation returns the entries found by scanners in the existing workspace for user-supplied text.

The request for the "Recognize" operation uses the URL `[GEODIURL]/DataExtractionHandler?op=Recognize&wsName=[WSNAME]&Text=[Text]&UserSession=[TOKEN]`. The `wsName` parameter specifies the Workspace Name, and the `Text` parameter is the text to be inspected.

The "Recognize" operation supports both GET and POST HTTP methods.

Expected errors for the "Recognize" operation include 401 Unauthorized access / Access denied, 403 Forbidden, 511 Network Authentication Required, and 501 Server Error.

The result value for the "Recognize" operation is a JSON object containing `ElapsedMilliseconds` and an `Entries` array. Each entry in the `Entries` array includes `OriginalText`, `Text`, `StartIndex`, `Length`, and `Filter`.

In the "Recognize" result, `ElapsedMilliseconds` indicates the milliseconds spent for recognition. `Entries` is a list of entrances recognized by GEODI. `OriginalText` is a piece of text where recognition occurs. `Text` is the text of the recognition made within the text. `StartIndex` is `OriginalText`'s starting position within the text, starting from 0. `Length` is `OriginalText`'s length.

The `Filter` field in the "Recognize" result represents the value created for the entry, if any. Within `Filter`, `StartDouble` is the beginning of the value range, `EndDouble` is the end of the range, and `IsFixedValue` indicates whether the value is constant, with False meaning it is a range value.

The `RecognizerID` in the "Recognize" result is the ID of the recognizer that recognizes the word. `ValueTypeCode` is an Enum value corresponding to the value type, with specific word value type equivalents.

The `ValueTypeCode` enum values and their equivalents are: 0: Empty, 1: Object, 2: DBNull, 3: Boolean, 4: Char, 5: SByte (-128, 127), 6: Byte (0, 255), 7: Int16 (-32768, 32767), 8: UInt16 (0, 65535), 9: Int32 (-2147483648, 2147483647), 10: UInt32 (0, 4294967295), 11: Int64 (-9223372036854775808, 9223372036854775807), 12: UInt64 (0, 18446744073709551615), 13: Single, 14: Double, 15: Decimal, 16: DateTime, and 18: String.

An example "Recognize" request is `[GEODIURL]/DataExtractionHandler?op=Recognize&wsName=PROJE&Text=10 blocks in 20th parcel`. The corresponding result for this example is a JSON object with `ElapsedMilliseconds:0` and an `Entries` array containing one entry where `OriginalText` is "10 blocks in 20th parcel", `Text` is "10 blocks in 20 parcels", `StartIndex` is 0, `Length` is 20, and `Filter` is null.

Example applications include .Net WinForm (C#) and HTML - Javascript.
