GEODI offers two methods for indexing email content and attachments. Files with *.PST or *.OST extensions are automatically indexed, requiring no user action. This document specifically addresses the process of indexing e-mail servers.

If an email server is not explicitly listed, users may utilize IMAP or POP3 protocols provided in "Other." Emails can be limited using a filter. While individual email accounts should generally be added one by one, a solution for adding all accounts at once is available for Exchange Server, explained on this page. Depending on indexing intensity, the email server may slow down or completely ban the user.

To establish a connection for email indexing, a valid email account and its associated information are required. If multiple accounts are to be discovered simultaneously for Exchange, specific user information is needed. Users can also configure a manual proxy for email connections by providing the Proxy Server Address, Proxy User, and Proxy Password.

For Exchange Server, it is possible to index all or selected accounts at once. This requires an authorized Exchange user. In GEODI, emails of all users can be indexed with a user who can access the email addresses of other users in the environment. To activate this feature, adjustments can be made in GEODI and the Mail Management interface, allowing multiple mails to be scanned from a single mail address into GEODI for searching and discovery. The "EWS" service must be turned on in Exchange Server to ensure the connection, with a reference provided at https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/deva/2011/12/01/how-to-get-the-ews-endpoint-url-from-outlook-20072010/.

Within the mail account, specific actions are required for indexing. A new contact must be added from the account in the "Contacts" tab. "Read and Manage" permission must be granted for the person being added. To add more than one contact to the list, the "Import Contacts" option may be used. The "EWS" service must be active on the Exchange Server, with a reference provided at https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/deva/2011/12/01/how-to-get-the-ews-endpoint-url-from-outlook-20072010/.

Email viewing in GEODI is based on user permissions. Users who log in to GEODI can view an indexed email if they are listed in the From, To, CC, or BCC fields of that email. Otherwise, only the system administrator can view the email. For support in implementing this feature, users can contact the technical team.
