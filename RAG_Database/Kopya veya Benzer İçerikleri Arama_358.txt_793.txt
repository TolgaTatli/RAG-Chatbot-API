GEODI's similarity search functionality allows users to find similar content between text and images. It can list similar items based on a provided image or text. Examples of similarity searches include `benzer:(doc:a.pdf)` or `similar:(doc:a.pdf)` to find documents similar to a specific file, and `benzer:”Ankara Kalesi"` to find documents similar to the first document containing "Ankara Kalesi".

For similarity searches, GEODI supports additional expressions to refine results. The `maxcount:` expression can limit the number of similar items returned. The `minsimilarity:0.7` expression allows modification of the similarity ratio, which has a default value of 0.7. Additionally, `excludeDuplicates:true` can be used to remove duplicates from the search results; its default setting is `false`.

GEODI assists in managing duplicate documents, which commonly constitute 40% of an organization's documents. These duplicates can lead to confusion and complicate search processes. GEODI's capability helps to identify and facilitate the elimination of such duplicates.

Users can search for duplicates in GEODI using specific commands. Typing `kopya` or `duplicate` will find all documents that have copies. To locate documents without copies, the command `-kopya` is used. More specific searches include `kopya:(doc:a.pdf)` to find copies of a particular document, or `kopya:"10 ada 20 Parsel Yapı Ruhsatı"` to find copies of the first document containing that phrase.

Both duplicate and similar documents are displayed within the GEODI search interface. These documents are also shown within GEODI's viewers.
