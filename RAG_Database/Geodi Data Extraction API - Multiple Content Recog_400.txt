A Token can be obtained by generating a Geodi Token.

The BulkRecognizeContents operation returns entries found by scanners in the existing workspace. These entries are derived from one or more content items submitted by the user to GEODI.

The request for BulkRecognizeContents uses the URL `[GEODIURL]/DataExtractionHandler?op=BulkRecognizeContents&wsName=[WSNAME]&content=[ContentJson]&UserSession=[TOKEN]`. The `wsName` parameter represents the Workspace Name, and `content` is a JSON object containing content information. Details for the content object can be found in the Geodi ContentObject - Content Definition Object document. The HttpMethod for this operation can be GET or POST.

Expected errors for the BulkRecognizeContents operation include 401 Unauthorized access / Access denied, 403 Forbidden, 511 Network Authentication Required, and 501 Server Error.

The returning value for the BulkRecognizeContents operation is a JSON object with the structure: `{ "ElapsedMilliseconds":0, "Entries": [ { "OriginalText":"", "Text":"", "StartIndex":0, "Length":1, "Filter":null } ] }`.

Within the returning value, `ElapsedMilliseconds` indicates the milliseconds spent for recognition. `Entries` is a list of entrances recognized by GEODI. Each entry contains `OriginalText`, which is a piece of text where recognition occurs; `Text`, which is the text of the recognition made within the text; `StartIndex`, representing OriginalText's starting position within the text (starting from 0); `Length`, which is OriginalText's length; and `Filter`, the value created for the entry, if any.

An example request for `[GEODIURL]/DataExtractionHandler?op=BulkRecognizeContents` includes a `Contents` array. This array contains objects, each with `ContentURL`, `DisplayName`, `ContentDate`, and `ViewURL`. For instance, one entry might have `ContentURL: '~/MyApplication/Content.php?id=1811'`, `DisplayName:'Document1'`, `ContentDate:'Mon, 06 May 2015 10:15:20 GMT'`, and `ViewURL: '~/MyApplication/ContentView.php?id=1811'`. Other examples include `Document2` and `Document3` with similar structures and different IDs.
