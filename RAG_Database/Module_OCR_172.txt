The GEODI OCR module can process scanned documents, images, and videos, making text and Barcode/QR codes within these data sources searchable.

To use the GEODI OCR module, a specific license is required. GEODI OCR offers two methods: one utilizes GEODI OCR infrastructure, and the other employs the ABBYY engine. The ABBYY option may necessitate additional licenses and per-use fees, while the GEODI OCR engine is noted for superior performance and does not incur non-license usage fees.

Setting up OCR for sources involves completing specific settings for each desired source. This includes the option to convert scanned documents to Searchable PDF (SPDF), which demands additional space and time, and results in the searched word being marked on the PDF. OCR for very large documents, such as a Scanned Project, is optional, and barcode and QR code recognition can also be provided.

General OCR settings are configured on the last page of the project wizard, and these settings affect all resources. Users can specify the OCR engine (GEODI or ABBYY) and add additional languages based on their documents. Fast OCR is available to save 50%-70% of time, though it slightly decreases performance. Generating SPDF can increase the total processing time by approximately 50%.

The "OCR those that have not been OCRed" command allows for activating OCR settings on a scanned project at a later time by initiating the Rescan service for OCR. This feature is useful because OCR can significantly increase the scanning time of a project; thus, projects can be initially scanned without OCR, and unprocessed items can be OCR-ed in the background later to save time. This command avoids repeated OCR and unnecessary file version increases, and can be executed via the user interface or DCC.

In the user interface, content for the "OCR those that have not been OCRed" command can be narrowed down by specifying query criteria in the "OCR Unprocessed" field. If OCR settings are not enabled in the project, this command will not allow non-OCR'd files to be processed, nor will it permit a new OCR process to start until an existing OCR repair process is complete. When the command is run, a message window opens confirming that content will be examined for background OCR processing.

OCR is a time-consuming process that can utilize significant computer or server resources, a factor to consider when dealing with a large volume of documents requiring OCR. The fastest option for OCR involves enabling SPDF and Fast OCR. The success and performance of the OCR process are dependent on the scan resolution and quality of documents, with decreased success for very old documents like blueprints, skewed cell phone pictures, or images from incompletely opened books. The C++ Runtime 2015-2019 package must be installed in the environment where the GEODI OCR module operates.

The GEODI OCR module includes technical settings configurable in the OCRSettings.json file, located in the GEODI/Settings/Geodi.OCR directory. If no settings have been made, this file will have a .sample extension, which must be deleted before saving it with a .json extension. JSON rules must be followed when writing content to this file, and GEODI requires a restart for these changes to take effect.

Specific technical settings in OCRSettings.json include "NoSpellCheck", which is a true/false option for correcting misspelled words using GEODI's dictionaries. "NoConnectedWordCheck" is a true/false setting that ensures the meaning of a word is preserved when a hyphen is placed at the end of a line for an incomplete word. "NoEnhance" is a true/false option that corrects defects in documents to be OCRed, performing the OCR process and placing found characters on the original page.

The "Quality" value in OCRSettings.json relates to the quality of images within the document, but it does not alter the OCR quality itself. A higher "Quality" value leads to increased OCR time and SPDF size. The "MaxPageCount" setting has a default value of 64, limiting the number of pages to be OCRed; only the first 64 pages are processed, with subsequent pages added as is. Increasing this value will also increase processing time.

The scope of training for GEODI Users covers topics such as what OCR is, its impact on search performance, expectations, and reviewing document samples for OCR, including good, dirty, cell phone, and book-scanned documents, along with barcode and QR code samples. It also includes photo and video OCR, explaining automatic processing via drag and drop or other data addition methods, barcode recognition, and awareness of OCR process performance. A specific URL for the Module OCR is provided.

For GEODI Admins, the training scope includes the difference between GEODI-OCR and ABBYY, emphasizing that GEODI OCR is better and has no price per transaction. It covers that the document focuses on GEODI OCR, that OCR requires processing power, and that OCRing everything initiates a long process. A specific URL for OCR Setup is provided.

Additional topics for GEODI Admin training include activating OCR for a source in a GEODI Project, activating barcode recognition, and general OCR settings within a GEODI Project. This also covers the FastOCR setting (speed, how to make, impact), the SPDF setting (capability, how to make, benefit, what happens without it, impact), and reasons for deleting or not deleting TIFFs (saving space as they are not necessary after OCR). Other topics include barcode recognition, OCR with videos, mask application (for removing camera traces and eliminating edges), details capturable with video OCR, OCRing all images, the fact that SPDF of GeoTIFF files does not occur, SPDF directory and metafile awareness, and OCR in different languages.
