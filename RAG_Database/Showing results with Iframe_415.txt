GEODI screens can be retrieved from a different application by specifying query text and used within an iframe. This functionality allows for the direct display of views such as Document, Map, Words, or Network graph within external software. By default, GEODI is disabled in an iframe when accessed from an external domain. To enable this, allowed addresses for the iframe must be configured in the "System Configuration - Security Settings". Additionally, the GEODI server is required to have an SSL certificate.

The Enterprise Search GUI request uses the `GET` HTTP method and follows the format `[GEODIURL]?wsName=[wsName]&GUIOptions=[GUIOptions]&Tab=[Tab]&loginWithGuest=1&q=[SearchString]`. The `wsName` parameter specifies the name of the workspace to search within. The `loginWithGuest` parameter, if optional, enables automatic guest login by ignoring the login screen when GEODI is opened with guest user support. The `q` parameter, also optional, represents the Query Text, and its syntax rules are detailed in "GEODI Queries". Expected errors for this request include `401 Unauthorized access / Access denied`, `403 Forbidden`, and `511 Network Authentication Required`.

The `Tab` parameter is optional and is used to specify the initial screen displayed. Its possible values include `DLV` to open the document list result, `KLV` to open the Word list result, `MAP` to open the map, and `DGRAPH` to open the network graph.

The `GUIOptions` parameter is optional and is used to specify which fields are shown or hidden in the interface. It utilizes flag bit values to control display options. Specific flag bit values include `SimpleResutView` (1), which shows results without query and facet; `HideDLV` (2), which hides the Document list result; `HideKLV` (4), which hides the Word list result; `HideMap` (8), which hides the Map; `HideKML` (16), which hides the KML export link; `HideExport` (32), which hides the Excel Export link; and `HideAdvanceQuery` (64), which hides the Advanced query.

Further `GUIOptions` flag bit values include `HideNoteIcon` (128), which hides annotation if prohibited in project definitions regardless of the submitted value; `HideFilter` (256), which hides the filtering link; `HideChangeProject` (512), which hides project switching options, allowing users to switch only to authorized projects if not specified; `HidePermissionMenu` (1024), which hides authority management links, displaying them only if required privileges exist and not specified; `HideProjectWizard` (2048), which hides project edit links, displaying them only if required privileges exist and not specified; `HideChangeLanguage` (4096), which hides links to change languages; and `HideLogout` (8192), which hides the log out link.

Additional `GUIOptions` flag bit values are `HideFacet` (16384), which hides the Facet screen; `ShowDGARPH` (32768), which activates the Network graph; `HideQueryBar` (65536), which hides the Query bar; `HideLogoBar` (131072), which hides the Logo bar; `DisableSimpleSearchStart` (262144), which disables simple search at the start if no query is present; `HideWatchQueries` (524288), which hides watch queries; `HideActions` (1048576), which hides action icons; and `HideRightDocInfoPanel` (2097152), which prevents the document information interface from opening on the right when clicking on a document, if the screen width is sufficient.

To ensure consistent results across all browsers, the `wsName` and `Query` parameters must be passed with URL encoding. For HTML content, a JavaScript function `UrlEncode(val)` can be used, which leverages `window.encodeURIComponent` or `val.replace(/&/g, '%26')`. For .Net environments, `System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlEncode` is available for URL encoding.

An example search URL is `http://127.0.0.1:3323/?wsName=Rotas%C4%B1z%20Seyyah&loginWithGuest=1&q=geodi`. To display only the result, an example URL is `http://127.0.0.1:3323/?wsName=Rotas%C4%B1z%20Seyyah&loginWithGuest=1&GUIOptions=131073&Tab=DLV&q=geodi`. In this case, `GUIOptions = 131073` combines `SimpleResutView` and `HideLogoBar` to display only the query result. The `Tab` value can be modified to `KLV` or `MAP` to show the Word list or Map, respectively, as demonstrated by examples like `http://127.0.0.1:3323/?wsName=Rotas%C4%B1z%20Seyyah&loginWithGuest=1&GUIOptions=131073&Tab=KLV&q=geodi` and `http://127.0.0.1:3323/?wsName=Rotas%C4%B1z%20Seyyah&loginWithGuest=1&GUIOptions=131073&Tab=MAP&q=geodi`. Another example for MAP is `http://127.0.0.1:3323/?wsName=Rotas%C4%B1z%20Seyyah&loginWithGuest=1&GUIOptions=1&Tab=MAP&q=geodi`.

For displaying a network graph, an example URL is `http://127.0.0.1:3323/?wsName=Rotas%C4%B1z%20Seyyah&loginWithGuest=1&GUIOptions=163841&Tab=DGRAPH&q=geodi`. Here, `GUIOptions = 163841` combines `SimpleResultView`, `HideLogoBar`, and `ShowDGARPH` to display the network graph result with simple results. The inclusion of `ShowDGARPH` enables viewing in the project settings even if the network chart is not initially opened.
