GEODI project or index backup and synchronization are driven by various needs. Backing up the index is crucial against possible loss, as indexing all data is time-consuming, and recovery from backup ensures uninterrupted service. GEODI can index changing content, allowing the difference between the backup and current index to be completed quickly. Daily backups are recommended, and GEODI installation is ready for this, requiring only activation. For Active-Passive disaster recovery configurations, an index copy is necessary for fast transition, with the same backup procedure applying. More information on Active-Passive and Active-Active configurations is available on a dedicated page.

The GEODI index is located at %appdata%\dece\geodi\GeodiIndex2.0. Files in this directory are in constant use, so backup should be performed using a specific command that securely backs up GEODI while it is running to a user-provided index directory. It is important to note that any notes taken after the last backup and documents added by drag and drop will be lost. Backup processes can be scheduled using the Windows scheduled task engine. Additionally, the GeodiWS Project file and other settings require synchronization, with instructions found on the Active-Passive and Active-Active configuration page.

GEODI Commands are available in files with a DCC extension, which can be executed via Batch or PowerShell. An example command for index backup is d.BackupIndex("[Destination Directory to Backup]","[WorkSpace name]"). When using this command, the destination directory and WorkSpace name must be edited appropriately, and if multiple WorkSpaces exist, each must be backed up separately. Scheduled tasks for these commands can be created using the Windows Task Scheduler or other preferred methods.

GEODI offers index recovery capabilities, allowing for repair of a damaged index or its replacement. Index repair can be a lengthy process and may fail depending on the extent of the damage, in which case restarting indexing is the only alternative. Therefore, recovery from backup, known as RestoreBackup, is the primary recommended choice. Three different recovery options are presented in the "Recovery Options" tab within the advanced settings on the last page of the GEODI Project Wizard.

The "Default" recovery option automatically initiates a repair process when GEODI is reopened and detects corruption in the GEODI Index, accompanied by a warning. The status of this repair can be monitored on the Project Management page. During this process, search and classification operations continue in other projects, while feeding operations are automatically suspended via GDE, which checks every two hours. In the project undergoing correction, an "Index Correcting" warning is displayed in the ES interface.

The "RestoreBackup" recovery option requires the user to specify the directory used for backup. This option utilizes backups created with the described backup method. If the specified backup directory contains no content or is inaccessible, the system will automatically revert to the "Default" recovery option.

The "DoNothing" recovery option provides no automatic repair or recovery from backup; instead, the index must be corrected manually. Depending on the level of damage to the index, it may still be possible to continue searching and other operations, but the manual correction remains necessary. The ES interface will indicate that the index is corrupted when this option is selected.
