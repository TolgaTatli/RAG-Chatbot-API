GEODI cannot perform destruction or quarantine actions on emails discovered from an Exchange Server.

It is possible to discover 50TB of data in 2 months or even less time.

Discovery in the product can be done in several stages. Using a method called sampled discovery, it is possible to discover 50TB of data from a database or file server in less than 1 week. Reports provided at the end of this period will reveal risky sources containing sensitive data and facilitate progress on authorization and other matters.

Sampled discovery is generally sufficient for databases. For a comprehensive discovery of file servers and other sources, GEODI processes data at an average speed of 0.5 to 1+ TB per day, completing 50TB of data within 50-100 days. This duration can be shortened by installing additional GEODI servers.
