Indexing in GEODI is the outcome of discovery, where GEODI generates brief information about data. This brief information is then utilized to respond to searches, reports, and other queries. The original data is not required by GEODI unless a user intends to open it in a viewer.

GEODI includes settings for indexing speed, with a suggestion to set it to maximum. Several factors influence indexing speed, including the CPU, memory, disk, and other server resources on which GEODI operates. The data throughput of the network and disk of data sources is also crucial. Additionally, options such as OCR or FacePro significantly impact performance.

When configuring indexing options, the initial setting should be "Index all Content." After this, other options can be utilized. If scheduled indexing is configured and periodic backups are in place, users will only need to use options related to maintenance needs.

Once indexing begins, the process can be monitored. A progress bar provides an approximate percentage of indexing, though it is not linear because GEODI cannot predict the time required for future documents; thus, it is an estimate based on previous document indexing times. The monitoring area also displays numerical data and graphics showing trends in documents per second. Furthermore, it indicates if any errors or warnings were generated, allowing users to click and download a report from the %appdata%logs folder, which includes error reports and detailed project reports.

The index requires storage space, and while its size will be considerably smaller than the original data, it is unpredictable, generally estimated to be between 10% to 20% of the data size. Options like sampling mode or similarity indexing can affect the index size. It is also recommended to reserve backup space for the index to ensure uninterrupted service.

After data sources are initially indexed, GEODI's continuous discovery feature automatically repeats the process for new data, such as rows, files, or emails. User intervention is not required; instead, the recheck period is configured within the Project Wizard.

Sampling is available for both structured and unstructured data, with each data source prompting for sampling values. This feature significantly reduces time for discovery projects. It is recommended to always use sampling for database discovery. For unstructured data, sampling serves as a good starting point to assess the data, identify unnecessary types, or detect permission issues.

File content filtering addresses the presence of various file types within a corpus, some of which may be irrelevant to the project scope or too large for the network or system. GEODI provides default rules, based on best practices from numerous Discovery projects, to exclude certain file types and impose size limitations. These rules and their modification methods are documented. These filters are universally applied to all files, regardless of their origin, such as folders, email attachments, GDE, or embedded databases.

Ignore rules, a component of file content filtering, specify file extensions, directory names, and patterns to exclude from indexing. The default list includes entries like *.DLL, *.SYS, and "program files." Any file matching these ignore rules is neither indexed nor logged. Settings for ignore rules are located in Settings\IgnoreFileTypes and \Settings\IgnoreFolders. To override defaults, modifications should be made in %appdata%. GDE also has additional ignore rules documented on its related page.

Known files are those for which GEODI possesses a reader, such as PDF or DOCX, with a full list available under "Supported Formats." These files are processed as expected unless an IgnoreRule or ProtectRule is active. An IgnoreRule will render the file type invisible, while a ProtectRule may impose size limitations.

By default, unknown file types are ignored. This setting can be overridden in the Project Wizard's advanced settings. If the "only name and date" option is selected, all unknown extensions will be indexed. While unwanted file types can be added to the ignore list, this action necessitates running discovery again from the beginning.

Protect rules are designed to safeguard the system and network from excessively large files and apply to both known and unknown files. Content is categorized as local or far. Local content, residing in local and network folders, has no size limitations. Far content, originating from sources like GDE, email attachments, and web pages, is subject to default filtering: any file larger than 100MB, and compressed files exceeding 500MB, are indexed by name only, meaning their content is not indexed. These settings are found in \Settings\Engine\ResourceBalancing, and defaults can be overridden in %appdata%.

Special queries are available to determine how content has been indexed. "status:OnlyName" retrieves content indexed with only its name and date, typically from UnknownFiles and ProtectRules. "status:HasScanError" identifies files unreadable due to errors or encryption, marked with an exclamation mark. "status:IsContainer" indicates files within a folder or compressed archives like ZIP/RAR. "status:IsCompletedIndex" signifies successfully indexed content. "status:Crashed" shows unsuccessful content after an index recovery following a system crash, which can be mitigated by using index backup. "Status:PartialRead" denotes content partially read due to ProtectRules. "GEODICryptedContent" refers to encrypted content, and "GEODICryptedContentPart" indicates partially encrypted content.

If indexing is slow, despite GEODI being a fast discovery engine, the issue may stem from the machine, settings, or environment. Troubleshooting steps include verifying that indexing speed is set high, checking for engine errors that might slow indexing if a source generates too many, and identifying other tasks consuming excessive resources. Too many recognizers or a slow disk can also impede indexing; consider dividing the index and placing parts on a faster disk like an SSD. Using sampling mode can provide quicker results.

High CPU usage by GEODI is expected, but it is designed not to render the machine unresponsive, always reserving one core for other tasks. If CPU usage is temporary, waiting may resolve it. For consistent high CPU usage, decreasing indexing speed is recommended. If OCR or FacePro options are in use, which require CPU, decreasing indexing speed or waiting is advised.

If the index size appears too high, despite GEODI compressing the index as much as possible (expecting up to 20% of corpus size), potential causes include an active similarity index, which requires disk space. Additionally, some files, such as logs or CSVs, may contain excessive information and can be excluded.

GEODI generates error logs during indexing, which primarily concern content and are often considered warnings or informational messages. Real system errors may occur, and users will be informed about them. Common content-related errors include unreadable content, encrypted content, and unreachable content due to permissions.

Discrepancies between the user's document count and GEODI's content count are normal because GEODI's count includes all folders and files within compressed archives like ZIP and RAR. Additionally, some file types may be present in ignore lists, contributing to the difference. Beyond these factors, users should ensure GEODI covers all intended content.
