Actions in GEODI Discovery include processes such as the disposal or quarantine of sensitive content, and they also cover data remediation processes. System administrators and members of a specific group can access these actions. To apply actions to desired projects, a particular setting must be configured.

Discovery-Disposal is an action where GEODI uses its reporting infrastructure to generate data remediation scripts, including disposal scripts. These ready-made scripts are in Windows Batch language and work for both local and remote (GDE) sources. Scripts can also be generated for languages like Bash or Python. Disposal is an irreversible process, requiring caution. Due to browser security measures, scripts are downloaded with the extension *.bat.txt and must be renamed to *.bat. The generated script should be run on the machine where the GEODI Server is located, as it may not work on different machines due to access rights, paths of remote files, or similar reasons.

Discovery-Quarantine creates a batch script that moves selected content to a designated directory, covering local, network, and remote directories provided by GDE. The selected files are moved to the quarantine area. Quarantine is an irreversible process, so caution is advised, and the quarantine directory must have sufficient space. The generated script should be run on the machine where the GEODI Server is located, as it may not work on different machines due to access rights, paths of remote files, or similar reasons. In the quarantine directory, content from local and network directories is stored in a similar hierarchy, while content from remote machines is prefixed with their IP address. Other conditions for Quarantine are the same as for Disposal.

Discovery-Encrypt involves an encryption report that creates a script to compress selected content into encrypted files within a directory without modifying the original files. This encryption covers local or network directories. Users can choose different passwords for different operations and are responsible for securely storing these passwords. The generated script should be run on the machine where the GEODI Server is located, as it may not work on different machines due to access rights, paths of remote files, or similar reasons. WinRAR must be installed on the machine where the encryption script is executed.

The "Delete the Deleteds" operation is used to remove files from the GEODI index that continue to appear in search results and reports even after being deleted during the GEODI discovery process. This operation removes deleted files from the index for both local and GDE-discovered files if they have been deleted. An alternate version of "Delete the Deleteds" is available on the Project/Maintenance menu.

Discovery-Batch-Masking requires a Masking license. This process involves a GEODI DCC file used to mask selected files, with DCC executable on the GEODI Server. Masking covers local and network sources. The generated script should be run on the machine where the GEODI Server is located, as it may not work on different machines due to access rights, paths of remote files, or similar reasons. The script requires specific parameters: a Token obtained from /API with masking permission, a MaskDataMetaID which is the profile ID of the masking pattern (IDs can be found on the https://decesw.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/geodien/pages/3977642003/Module+GEODI+Data+Masking page), and a designated place to store masked files with sufficient storage.
