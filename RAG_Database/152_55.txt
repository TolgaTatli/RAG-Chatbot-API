A policy can be implemented to classify all documents created by person A within an institution as confidential.

This classification can be achieved by selecting and classifying documents using the 'owner:A' query.

As an alternative, documents visible to user A can be selected using the 'user:A' query.

Date parameters and all capabilities supported by GEODI can be added to these queries.
