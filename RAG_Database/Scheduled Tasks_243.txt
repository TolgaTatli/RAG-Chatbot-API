GEODI features a powerful scheduler that automates various tasks. Templates are provided for frequently used tasks.

Scheduled Discovery is performed within the last page of the project wizard. To activate it, users must activate the scheduled Index and set the time.

By default, all GEODI projects are configured to be backed up daily at 03:00. These backups are stored in the Backup folder, which is located under the Project Workspace directory.

Backup settings can be modified in the "Advanced Settings" section of the Project Wizard. It is recommended to make changes to these settings only if there is a specific requirement.

The template for Scheduled Report Mail is designed to send a Summary report weekly on Monday at 09:00 clock. Users have the option to change the report or the period.

The SendWeeklyReport.jSettings.sample template is found in the Settings\Notifications\TimedNotification folder. To use it, this file must be renamed to SendWeeklyReport.jSettings.

To customize the Scheduled Report Mail template, the [TOMAIL] value needs to be replaced with the desired recipients. Multiple e-mail addresses can be separated using a semicolon (";").

For the Scheduled Report Mail template, the [WSNAME] value should be set to the workspace name.

Multiple settings can be configured for different periods, projects, or reports by copying the jsettings file and assigning a new ID.

The template for Discovery and Automatic Classification is designed to automatically classify each newly received document.

The ScheduledClassifier.jsettings.Sample template is located in the \Settings\Notifications\Geodi.OnScanEnd\ folder.

For the Discovery and Automatic Classification template, a [GEODI_TOKEN] can be obtained. The [GEODIURL] should be set to the project's URL address, and [WSNAME] should be set to the project's workspace name.

The template for "Summary Report via Email When Discovery is Completed" is designed to send an email containing a summary report and a notification once the discovery process is finished.

The ScanEnded.jsettings.sample file is located in the directory. To activate this template, ScanEnded.jsettings.sample must be renamed to ScanEnded.jsettings.

To customize the "Summary Report via Email When Discovery is Completed" template, the [TOMAIL] value must be replaced with the recipient's email addresses. Multiple recipients can be separated using a semicolon (";").
