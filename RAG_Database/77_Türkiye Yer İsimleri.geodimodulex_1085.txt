When defining a Source Fileserver to GEODI, it is possible to perform scanning by entering a User Screen and Password.

GEODI allows users to utilize dictionaries, such as "Turkey Places," to view their documents on the Turkey map. This functionality enables the display of locations like the city where a customer works, the district where business is conducted, or an address found on an invoice, all on the map.
