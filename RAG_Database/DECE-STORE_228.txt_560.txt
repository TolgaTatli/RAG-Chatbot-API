DECE-STORE is a repository backed by GEODI search, designed to customize GEODI for specific needs, such as different regulations and countries.

Each package within DECE-STORE contains various recognizers, reports, and templates. These packages are continuously improved and updated, which also results in updates to GEODI.

For offline environments, DECE-STORE is unavailable unless access to service.decesoftware.com is permitted. Users in such environments should consult offline installation procedures.

The DECE-STORE allows users to search by regulation, country, or a specific entity, such as an SSN (Social Security Number).

The Map feature in DECE-STORE displays specific solutions for a country. Users can click on a country to install its related module.
