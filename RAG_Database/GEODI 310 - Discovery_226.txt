This training covers the basics of discovery and the discovery cycle, assuming the user has basic knowledge of GEODI Discovery, its relationship with DSPM, and has a running GEODI installation. The content is technical and general, with a duration of 30 minutes plus 45 minutes for application. Trainings are intended to provide a general idea, requiring reinforcement through application, and some mentioned features may not be included in the user's license.

Discovery uncovers “risks” or hidden value within millions of pages of documents and tens of millions of database records. The nature of discovery can vary significantly depending on the organization and its specific purpose. For instance, some organizations require discovery to comply with regulations like KVKK, PCI-DSS, or GDPR, while a lawyer or intelligence officer performing Digital Forensics focuses on different aspects, and a press publisher might seek faces. GEODI Discovery addresses these diverse needs and can be extended via add-ons available in the DECE-STORE.

Data discovery is an important yet challenging task. Data is frequently scattered across numerous sources, including File Servers, Databases, Sharepoint, PCs, e-mail, and Dropbox. A key challenge is the absence of a common rule for unstructured data originating from these varied sources, and speed is also a necessary requirement for this process.

GEODI Discovery Solution offers several advantages, including ready-made discovery packages for regulations like KVKK, GDPR, and PCI-DSS, with templates for various countries and regulations available in the DECE STORE, alongside many different tools. It provides high speed, processing 0.5-1TB+ per day, and achieves low false positives and high discovery accuracy due to its use of NLP and AI. The solution also offers flexible reporting to meet diverse needs.

Further advantages of GEODI Discovery include its Big Data/Architecture, which, with GEODI Cluster architecture, enables data discovery at the Petabyte (PB) level, supporting multiple GEODI instances or NLB. It provides automatic tools for Data Curation, Destruction, Quarantine, and Encryption based on Workflow, functioning across Windows, Linux, and MacOS endpoints. The solution also supports Continuous Discovery, which is incremental and reduces workload, allowing for easy matching of workflows and setups for automation like destruction, quarantine, and risky data alarms. Additionally, GEODI Discovery offers rich connection and adapter options, supporting dozens of different sources and hundreds of different file types through agented and agentless exploration.

GEODI's Semantic Search capability combines discovery and search, which is presented as a significant advantage, especially since some solutions only search by file name and limited criteria. Search is a core function for GEODI, providing a wealth of options useful for reviewing discovery results, automated actions, and reporting. Regarding who sees discovery results, GEODI offers many options, specifying that system administrators do not see them, while certain users, such as users A, B, and C, do.
