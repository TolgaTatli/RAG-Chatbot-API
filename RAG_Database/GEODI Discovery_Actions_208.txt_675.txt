Actions encompass processes like disposal or quarantine of sensitive content found by GEODI Discovery, and they also cover data remediation processes. System administrators and members of a specific group can access these actions. To apply actions to desired projects, a particular setting must be configured.

GEODI's reporting infrastructure generates data remediation scripts, including the disposal script. These ready-made scripts are in Windows Batch language and function for both local and remote (GDE) sources. Scripts can also be generated in languages like Bash or Python. Disposal is an irreversible process, requiring caution. Due to browser security measures, disposal scripts are downloaded with a *.bat.txt extension and must be renamed to *.bat. Generated disposal scripts may not work on different machines due to access rights or remote file paths, and should be run on the machine where the GEODI Server is located.

The Quarantine action creates a batch script to move selected content to a designated directory, covering local, network, and remote directories provided by GDE. Selected files are moved to the quarantine area. Quarantine is an irreversible process, requiring caution, and the quarantine directory must have sufficient space. Similar to disposal scripts, generated quarantine scripts may not work on different machines due to access rights or remote file paths, and should be run on the GEODI Server machine. In the quarantine directory, content from local and network directories is stored in a similar hierarchy, while content from remote machines is prefixed with their IP address.

The Discovery-Encrypt action generates a script that compresses selected content into encrypted files within a directory, without altering the original files. This encryption applies to local or network directories. Users can choose different passwords for various operations and are responsible for securely storing these passwords. The generated encryption script may not function on different machines due to access rights or remote file paths, and should be executed on the GEODI Server machine. WinRAR must be installed on the machine where the encryption script is run.

Files indexed during the GEODI discovery process may still appear in search results and reports even after being deleted. To remove these files from the index, the "Delete Deleteds" operation must be used. This operation removes deleted local and GDE-discovered files from the index. An alternate version of "Delete the Deleteds" is available on the Project/Maintenance menu.

The Discovery-Batch-Masking report requires a Masking license. Batch masking uses a GEODI DCC file to mask selected files, and DCC can be run on the GEODI Server. Masking covers local and network sources. The generated script for batch masking may not work on different machines due to access rights or remote file paths, and should be run on the GEODI Server machine. The script requires specific parameters: a Token from /API with a user having masking permission, a MaskDataMetaID which is the profile ID of the masking pattern (IDs can be found on the https://decesw.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/geodien/pages/3977642003/Module+GEODI+Data+Masking page), and a storage location for masked files with sufficient space.
