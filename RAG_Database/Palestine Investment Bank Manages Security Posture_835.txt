Palestine Investment Bank (PIB) streamlined data classification and improved data security through a partnership with GEODI and TJDEED Technology. This collaboration successfully safeguarded sensitive information.

Abdulrahim Hasan, IT Director at Palestine Investment Bank (PIB), stated that the collaboration between PIB's internal team, vendor DECE Software, and partner TJDEED Technology was critical for their Data Classification project (DECE, GEODI). PIB's team was responsible for understanding organizational needs and tailoring the data classification framework. DECE Software and TJDEED Technology provided robust tools and technical expertise, enabling a more efficient and accurate classification process. This partnership ensured seamless system integration, empowered sensitive data safeguarding, enhanced compliance, and improved overall data governance for PIB.

Palestine Investment Bank (PIB), founded in 1994 by Arab and Palestinian bankers, is dedicated to the development of Palestine’s economy. Operating 22 branches across the country and employing over 700 people, PIB prioritizes protecting its customers' sensitive information, aligning with its core values of truthfulness, honesty, and excellence.

As Palestine Investment Bank (PIB) expanded, managing vast amounts of data across multiple locations became a challenge. Sensitive data was spread across PCs, shared folders, and databases, making it difficult for PIB’s information security teams to ensure data protection and compliance. The bank, founded 30 years ago, faced localization needs to comply with local regulations and its custom requirements, holding very different types of sensitive information within its data sources. With over 3 million documents stored over decades, PIB faced challenges in accurately discovering, classifying, and securing information, particularly unstructured data.

Palestine Investment Bank (PIB) partnered with GEODI to deploy a comprehensive data discovery and classification solution. GEODI consolidated various data sources, detecting sensitive and personal data in both structured and unstructured formats using advanced semantic discovery techniques. GEODI also empowered users to classify documents and emails on their PCs through flexible classification levels and intuitive plugins, which ensured smoother adoption. PIB’s security teams automated the classification of data based on GEODI’s intelligent recognizers and analysis, ensuring critical information was securely identified and managed.

Thanks to GEODI, Palestine Investment Bank (PIB) saw immediate benefits, with an average of 6,000 files and emails automatically classified each day. More than 3 million documents were scanned, discovered, and automatically classified across the bank’s shared folders and PCs. Unnecessary sensitive data can now be quickly quarantined or deleted, ensuring only essential data remains. Incremental scans allow for continuous monitoring, and GEODI’s semantic search features enable the team to quickly locate critical information. Classified sensitive data fields are accurately done, and tagged files are available for preventing leakage through DLP solutions. The entire data landscape at PIB is now manageable and secure, with new data continuously classified for protection, and its Data Security Posture is under control with GEODI’s persistence data scan, discovery, classification, and remediation functionalities.

GEODI's cutting-edge Natural Language Processing-based Semantic Discovery, Classification, and Search capabilities have empowered Palestine Investment Bank (PIB) to manage its complex data structures effectively. With easy configuration and end-user adoption, PIB’s staff embraced a culture of data security and privacy. PIB continues to meet regulatory compliance with GDPR, PCI/DSS, and Information Security standards while ensuring the integrity and protection of its sensitive data.

Palestine Investment Bank's success story showcases the power of GEODI in transforming data management and safeguarding customer information across a rapidly growing enterprise. The bank also thanked its partner TJDEED Technology for their support and collaboration in the project.
