Existing GEODI user interfaces can be customized, and new reports, dashboard definitions, and event behaviors can be added.

Within GEODI, Enterprise Search (ES) and Digital Atlas (DA) are available as initial query pages.

Customizations can be made by adding HTML files and scripts to interfaces, and by preparing new views for the ES interface.

Specific customization actions include writing HTML Plugins, creating a Dashboard, creating a Query View, editing document list results, creating a Theme, creating a Layout, creating a Template, modifying Map styles, and adding a Banner to the Project.
