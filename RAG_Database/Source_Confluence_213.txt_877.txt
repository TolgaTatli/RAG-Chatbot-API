Confluence/Wiki directories are indexed and discovered like Windows directories. File neglect rules apply to these directories.

Users can explore pages within their Confluence Online permissions by entering their username and password.

With Confluence Public, external resources can be discovered by providing only the domain.

Documents on pages discovered using the “Include Attachments” option will be indexed. The increase in indexing time associated with this process should not be overlooked.

If a private address is to be discovered, username and password information must be used.
