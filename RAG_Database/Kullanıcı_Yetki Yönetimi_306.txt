The number of active sessions in GEODI is dependent on the number of users.

User creation, permission definition, and group management are handled via the “/Ayarlar/Kullanıcı ayarları/Yetki Yönetimi” path. Within this interface, the "Groups" tab allows for managing groups and their associated permissions, while the "Users" tab is used to define users, send messages, and associate users with groups.

GEODI permissions are assigned to groups. The "System Administrator" group can create users and groups, and add or remove users from groups. It is recommended to create at least the "GEODI Kullanıcıları", "GEODI Yöneticileri", and "GEODI Sistem Yöneticileri" groups. The number of members in a group is specified, and a single user can be a member of multiple groups.

GEODI supports LDAP/Active Directory integration. The machine where GEODI is installed must be within the same domain. LDAP groups can be added by creating a corresponding group in GEODI. GEODI automatically utilizes the permissions of LDAP group members. Management for users originating from LDAP occurs on the Active Directory side.

Changes to passwords stored in LDAP affect GEODI. If users are deleted from LDAP, they will no longer be able to access GEODI. When matching LDAP users with groups, typing a username will present similar names from LDAP as options, which simplifies management in networks with many LDAP users.

LDAP users are displayed in the `domain\username` format. Their management is entirely handled by Active Directory, so no additional options are provided within GEODI for these users. GEODI Notification services use the email addresses defined in Active Directory for LDAP users.

GEODI utilizes folder and file-based permissions granted in Active Directory. GEODI cannot override restrictions set in Active Directory but can impose new ones. To enable the use of folder permissions from Active Directory, the `SupportLDAPPermissions` setting within the `ContentReadereEnumerators` section of project detail settings must be set to `true`.

Permissions are managed by determining which permissions each group will use. Permission categories can vary based on installed modules; for example, the MOBIDI Connector application module adds categories related to MOBIDI Office. Permissions are assigned to groups, and user permissions are automatically updated after a certain period when users are added to or removed from groups. If immediate updates are desired, permissions can be re-read via the "Yetkileri Düzenle" option on the GEODI Project scanning screen. If no selections are made for any group, it is interpreted as no authorization, and the permission button appears unlocked.

Users can originate from LDAP/AD or be GEODI-specific users. Management of LDAP users is handled by Active Directory, and changes made in AD, such as email or password updates, may take 10-30 minutes to reflect in GEODI, during which time older information remains valid. New users can be sent an invitation email if their email address is defined. Users who forget their password can request a new one from the login page.

If the license permits, GEODI projects can be made publicly accessible through the definition of guest users. Guest users are a practical solution for information-sharing projects, such as digital city archives or treasury ministry projects. Guest users must be activated from settings, included in a group, and assigned appropriate project permissions. They will appear as "guest" in the user list.

GEODI can integrate with authentication sources like Google and Facebook, allowing users to log in using these services. Pre-defined configurations exist for Google, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Microsoft. To activate these, their extensions must be set to `jSettings`. Activated sources will appear on the login page. Permissions for users from these sources must be separately defined by including them in a group. To grant permissions to all users from a source like Google, select the desired group, enter "*" for users, and choose Google. Alternatively, entering a specific user's email address instead of "*" grants permission only to that individual.

GEODI's infrastructure supports external user authentication services beyond LDAP and can integrate with other platforms used by organizations. Providing the services specified at `developers.dece.com.tr` is sufficient for integration. GEODI can also integrate with user authentication features of services like Facebook and Google.

Project-specific permissions can be defined. If no group is assigned a permission, all users will have that permission. Project-based permissions include: "Projeyi Görebilir" (determines which groups can view the project), "Projeyi Düzenleyebilir" (grants permission to make changes in the project), "Projeyi Indeksleyebilir" (permission for scanning the project from scratch or for changes), "Projeyi Silebilir" (permission to delete a project, without which the delete button will not appear), "Rapor Alabilir" (allows taking export reports related to the project), and "Veri Operatörü" (permission to tag and group results recognized by modules like FacePro and TextPro).

Resource-based authorizations can be implemented within a project. If no group is assigned a permission, all users will have that permission. Resource-based permissions include: "Arayabilir" (determines who can view the relevant resource), "Paylaşabilir" (enables sharing from the GEODI-defined Twitter account), "Görüntüleyebilir/İndirebilir" (allows authorized users to download and view files within the relevant resource), "Not Ekleyebilir" (permission to add notes to files and folders in the relevant resource), "Başkalarının Notlarını Düzenleyebilir" (grants permission to modify other users' notes), and "Ekleyebilir/Besleyebilir" (allows uploading files to the relevant resource via the browser).

To view the permissions of a logged-in user and clear the permission cache in GEODI, navigate to the "Api" section, then "User Manager Api". To view permissions, click "[RUN]" next to `GetCurrentUserInfoWithPermissions()`. To clear the permission cache, which can be used for immediate reflection of permission changes, click "[RUN]" next to `ClearCurrentUserPermissionCache()`.

By default, System Administrators have privileged access and can view all content. This privilege can be removed by setting the `SystemAdminSuperUserOverride` value to `TRUE` (default is `FALSE`) in the `SystemSettings` file, which will apply to all workspaces. Further details are available at `https://destek.dece.com.tr/space/PAR/87209813/Sistem+Yapılandırma+ve+Güvenlik+Ayarları`. After this setting, necessary permissions must be configured for each data source. For example, a DPO group's members might be able to open, report, and review all findings, while System Administrators cannot, as illustrated with resource SG-43. It is important to note that when all checkboxes are unchecked, all tools are open by default; however, checking a box means permissions must be granted individually.
