The Language Pack is an add-on that enhances GEODI's language capabilities. While GEODI inherently supports basic English, this add-on introduces support for German, Russian, Arabic, Georgian, Croatian, and Albanian languages. Furthermore, the Language Pack incorporates date-time rules, which GEODI is then able to recognize.

Following the installation of the Language Pack, users are required to select their desired language through the user preferences.

The version of the Language Pack is 1.0.0.12.
