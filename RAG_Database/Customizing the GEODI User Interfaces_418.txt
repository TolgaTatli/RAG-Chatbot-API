Existing GEODI user interfaces can be customized. Users can also add new reports, dashboard definitions, and event behaviors.

Within GEODI, ES (Enterprise Search) and DA (Digital Atlas) are available. These serve as initial query pages.

Customizations can be made by adding HTML files and scripts to interfaces. New views can also be prepared for the ES interface.

Specific customization actions include writing HTML Plugins, creating a Dashboard, and creating a Query View. Other actions involve editing document list results, creating a Theme, creating a Layout, and creating a Template. Additionally, map styles can be customized, and a Banner can be added to the Project.
