This MSI package contains Classifier Desktop (Shell Extension) and Microsoft Office add-ons.

The GEODI Classifier SETUP tab automatically generates the parameters. Installation can be performed manually or by using a tool like ManageEngine for deployment.

Office add-ons cannot be disabled or removed by users; only system administrators can perform these actions.

Installed agents are monitored with a panel, which is described in GEODI as the Agent Management Panel.

Installation conditions include requiring a GEODI Workspace for Classification policies, ensuring the GEODI URL address is accessible from the endpoints, and utilizing a tool such as ManageEngine, SCCM, or PDQ for multiple PCs.

The Classifier Agent can be found in /GUI/Agents/Classifier.

The GEODI_URL parameter specifies the address that agents will use to access GEODI, and a secure and named address (DNS, SSL) is recommended.

The GEODI_WSNAME parameter refers to the GEODI Workspace name where policies are defined, and agents will update these policies.

The GEODI_TOKEN is generated in Classification Settings. It is recommended to create a separate user for the token because the token user password should not be changed.

The following commands can be used for agent deployment with tools such as PDQ, ManageEngine, or SCCM.

For setup, the command is "GEODI.Classifier.msi" /quiet GEODI_URL="https://.." GEODI_WSNAME="ClassifierWorkspace" GEODI_TOKEN=. The GEODI Classifier SETUP tab automatically generates these parameters.

To uninstall the agent, the command is msiexec.exe /x "GEODI.Classifier.msi" /qn /norestart.

To update, the command is start "" "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\DECE Software\GEODI Classifier\Updater.exe", which runs the Updater. This command is typically not needed because agents update themselves.

Agents will check for updates every two days and update themselves from the GEODI server, so user intervention is not required.
