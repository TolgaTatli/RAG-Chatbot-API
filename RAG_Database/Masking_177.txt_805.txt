According to GEODI discovery results, masking or anonymization can be applied to files and databases. Masking refers to obscuring sensitive data in content or replacing it with a fixed text. Anonymization, on the other hand, involves replacing a value with other values that appear to be real. With masking, sensitive data is completely obscured, while anonymization breaks the link with real data but still maintains the appearance of real data. By anonymizing data containing sensitive information, it can be easily shared with testing teams, data analysis teams, or researchers.

How findings should be masked can be determined. Data can be simply replaced with an asterisk (*), or a name or phone number can be replaced with a distinct value such as [NAME] or [TELNO]. For identifiers like IBAN or credit card numbers, the first 2 and last 4 characters can be used. For names, applying Module: GEODI Data Masking, such as capitalizing the first letter, is possible. Content names, including file names and e-mail subjects, are not masked.

Masking can be done in several ways, including Permanent File Masking, Dynamic Masking, and Database Masking. Permanent File Masking allows alteration of discovery layers identified as permanent or copy in file-based data, with rules definable separately for personal data, financial data, or all data. A copy document can be created where all identified words are hidden, and different masking options may exist for various departments. Dynamic Masking dynamically changes discovery layers for selected groups or users, allowing one user to see a document in its entirety while another views it with financial areas or personal data hidden. Database Masking creates a masked or anonymized copy of a given database as the source, making it possible to mask a database for software development teams.

For Persistent File Masking, GEODI creates a copy of the content undergoing masking, and the operation functions in a "Mask and Download" manner. This process can also be performed in bulk using the "Batch Mask/Anonymize" action from the Actions menu, which creates a script for system administrators. For individual files or a small number of files, modified copies can be generated using the masking/anonymization process within the viewer.

Masking operates in various formats, including Word (*.doc, *.docx, *.rtf), Excel (*.xlsm, *.csv, *.xlsx, *.xls), PDF (*.pdf), Powerpoint (*.ppt, *.pptx, *.ppsx), and LibreOffice (*.odp, *.odt, *.ods). In the viewers of these supported formats for the masking process, access is available.

Users can mask all discovered data or a selected subset by creating as many definitions, referred to as Masking Metadata, as needed. Default definitions are provided, and changes and additions can be made. For example, a name like "Hasan HÃ¼seyin" can be masked as "[NAME]" or "****". Different masking formats can be defined based on different identifiers using these definitions, allowing names, IBANs, and currency expressions to be masked differently.

With dynamic masking, discovery results are visible in a masked form across screens such as the viewer, words, network graph, and summary. Masking in the viewer applies to various types, including Office Files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), Open Office (ODT, ODS, ...), PDF, TXT, and XPS, regardless of their source, whether embedded in a File Server, SharePoint, or Database. Dynamic Masking settings are configured by selecting the "Dynamic Masking" box on the last page of the project wizard. Once adjustments are made, files in the project are displayed to users in a masked format.

Dynamic Masking operates with group-based authorization, where a masking metadata is defined for each group. When group members open a file from the project, it is displayed in a masked form according to the defined masking metadata. The "No Masking" setting displays results without masking for a defined group. Any group or user not matched with a profile is assumed to use the MaskALL profile. When files are downloaded, they are also downloaded in a masked form.

Database masking performs permanent masking on a given database. If the original data needs to remain intact, users can work on a copy. Database masking provides several use cases, such as sharing a database with software or testing teams, where it permanently removes sensitive data. It also allows for safely sharing a database for data analysis by permanently removing sensitive information.

Masking authorization is the same as document download authorization, meaning those with download permissions can use it. For dynamic masking, authorization can be done based on the user and the discovery layer. A MASKING and DISCOVERY license is required for these functionalities.
