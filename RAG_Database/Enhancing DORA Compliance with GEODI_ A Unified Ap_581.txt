The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is a critical framework designed to ensure the operational resilience of digital assets within the financial sector, addressing increasing regulatory demands on financial firms. GEODI offers a comprehensive solution to help financial institutions meet these stringent DORA requirements, utilizing its capabilities in enterprise search, data discovery, masking, and classification. GEODI specifically contributes to articles 4, 5, 9, and 15 of DORA through its various modules and features.

DORA mandates that financial firms adopt robust measures to secure their digital operations against disruptions and cyber threats, encompassing data protection, risk management, and incident response. Achieving compliance with DORA is not merely about meeting regulatory demands but also about safeguarding the integrity of business operations.

GEODI supports DORA compliance through its comprehensive data discovery and enterprise search tools, which provide financial firms with full visibility into their digital assets. By indexing and cataloging all relevant data across various platforms, GEODI enables firms to identify potential vulnerabilities and maintain up-to-date inventories of their digital operations. This comprehensive visibility is essential for risk management, a cornerstone of DORA compliance.

GEODI also supports DORA compliance with advanced data masking capabilities, which are vital for protecting sensitive information, a top priority under DORA. These capabilities allow financial institutions to obfuscate sensitive financial data, thereby reducing the risk of exposure during cyber incidents. This ensures that even if data is compromised, it remains protected, aligning with DORA’s stringent data protection standards.

Furthermore, GEODI supports DORA compliance through risk-based data classification, addressing DORA's requirement for firms to adopt a risk-based approach to data management. GEODI’s automated data classification tools enable organizations to categorize data based on its sensitivity and regulatory importance. By accurately classifying data, financial firms can prioritize security measures and respond to incidents more effectively, ensuring critical information is always safeguarded.

GEODI supports DORA compliance by providing continuous monitoring of data security posture, which enables real-time detection and response to potential threats. This proactive monitoring is essential for maintaining the operational resilience required by DORA. Additionally, GEODI’s audit-ready reporting capabilities assist firms in demonstrating compliance during regulatory inspections, ensuring all requirements are met seamlessly.

GEODI's remediation actions, based on semantic data discovery and sensitivity analysis, further support DORA compliance by enabling financial firms to delete or securely move sensitive data. This ensures compliance with DORA while simultaneously reducing risk and enhancing data governance.

GEODI offers a unified platform that simplifies the complex process of DORA compliance and enhances the overall security and resilience of financial institutions. By leveraging GEODI’s capabilities in enterprise search, data discovery, masking, and classification, financial firms can confidently protect their digital assets, mitigate risks, and meet regulatory requirements, ensuring their operations remain resilient against any challenge.
