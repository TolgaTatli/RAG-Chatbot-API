According to GEODI discovery results, masking or anonymization can be applied to files and databases. Masking refers to obscuring sensitive data in content or replacing it with a fixed text. Anonymization involves replacing a value with other values that appear real. With masking, sensitive data is completely obscured, while anonymization breaks the link with real data but still maintains the appearance of real data. Anonymizing data containing sensitive information allows for easy sharing with testing teams, data analysis teams, or researchers.

The method for masking findings can be determined. Data can be replaced with an asterisk (*), or a name or phone number can be replaced with a distinct value like [NAME] or [TELNO]. For identifiers such as IBAN or credit card numbers, the first two and last four characters can be used. Capitalizing the first letter is also a possible case. Content names, including file names and e-mail subjects, are not masked.

Masking can be performed in several ways, including Permanent File Masking, Dynamic Masking, and Database Masking. Permanent File Masking allows alteration of discovery layers identified as permanent or copy in file-based data, with rules definable for personal, financial, or all data. Dynamic Masking enables discovery layers selected with specific groups or users to change dynamically, meaning one user might see a document in its entirety while another views it with hidden financial or personal data. Database Masking creates a masked or anonymized copy of a given database as the source, making it possible to mask a database for software development teams.

For Persistent File Masking, GEODI creates a copy of the content undergoing masking. The operation functions as "Mask and Download". This process can also be performed in bulk using the "Batch Mask/Anonymize" action from the Actions menu, which generates a script for the system administrator to execute. For individual or a small number of files, modified copies can be generated using the masking/anonymization process within the viewer.

Masking operates in various formats including Word (*.doc, *.docx, *.rtf), Excel (*.xlsm, *.csv, *.xlsx, *.xls), PDF (*.pdf), Powerpoint (*.ppt, *.pptx, *.ppsx), and LibreOffice (*.odp, *.odt, *.ods). Access to the masking process is available for viewers of supported formats under a specific button. Users can create multiple definitions, also known as masking metadata, to mask all discovered data or a selected subset. Default definitions are provided, and changes or additions can be made using the specified method. For example, a name like "Hasan HÃ¼seyin" can be masked as "[NAME]" or "****", and different masking formats can be defined for identifiers such as names, IBANs, and currency expressions.

With dynamic masking, discovery results are masked and visible on screens such as the viewer, words, network graph, and summary. Masking in the viewer applies to various file types, including Office Files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), Open Office (ODT, ODS, etc.), PDF, TXT, and XPS, regardless of their source (File Server, SharePoint, or Database). To configure dynamic masking, the "Dynamic Masking" box is selected on the project wizard's last page, and settings are configured. Once adjustments are made, files in the project are displayed to users in a masked format.

Dynamic Masking operates with group-based authorization, where a masking metadata is defined for each group. When group members open a file from the project, it is displayed in a masked form according to their defined masking metadata. The "No Masking" setting allows results to be displayed without masking for a defined group. Any group or user not matched with a profile is assumed to use the MaskALL profile. When files are downloaded, they are also downloaded in a masked form.

Database masking performs permanent masking on a given database, with the option to work on a copy to keep the original data intact. This feature provides several use cases, such as permanently removing sensitive data when sharing a database with software or testing teams. It also allows for safe sharing of a database for data analysis by permanently removing sensitive information.

Masking authorization is equivalent to document download authorization, meaning those with download permissions can utilize it. For dynamic masking, authorization can be configured based on the user or group, or based on discovery results.

Known issues for Permanent Masking include that discovery results from multiple columns are not masked. Masking is not applied in Excel or database records if the cell or column type is numeric, meaning values like IBAN or credit card numbers are detected but not masked. Similarly, if the cell or column type is a date in Excel or databases, date values are discovered but not masked. In Excel or database cells, if a paragraph contains more than one finding, only one is masked; for example, if a name and an ID number occur, only one will be masked. Additionally, some files like .mobi and .xps cannot be permanently masked, though dynamic masking is possible for them.

A MASKING and DISCOVERY license is required for these operations. Known issues for Dynamic Masking include that emails are not masked on the viewer, although their attachments are masked according to defined rules. Similar to permanent masking, some files such as .mobi and .xps cannot be permanently masked, but dynamic masking is possible. Database (DB) contents appear masked in the DLV interface but are shown unmasked in the viewer.
