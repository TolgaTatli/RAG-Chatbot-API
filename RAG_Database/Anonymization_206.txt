Based on GEODI discovery results, files and databases can be Masked or Anonymized. Masking involves obscuring sensitive data within content or replacing it with a fixed alternative text, which completely removes the sensitive data. Anonymization, conversely, replaces a value with another value that appears real, breaking the link with the original data while maintaining its realistic appearance. Anonymizing sensitive information or databases facilitates sharing them with test teams, data analysis teams, or researchers.

In Anonymization, each value is replaced with a compatible alternative, such as a name replaced with another name or a phone number with another phone number. Ready-to-use values for anonymization include Name, Money, Dictionaries (like Placename or part number), Creditcard, IBAN, Tel, e-Mail, and Date, where each is replaced with a value from its respective category or a random value from the same dictionary for dictionary types.

Anonymization has two modes. In the Default mode, the same original value is consistently converted to the same anonymized value, meaning a name like "John Smit" would be converted to the same anonymized name everywhere it appears. In the other mode, conversion is always random, preventing the same results from being seen even within a single session. This second mode is configured in the project generic settings.

Profiles are used to define which findings are to be anonymized. Users may choose to anonymize all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Financial data. The functions prompt the user to select from existing profiles.

Anonymization in content can be applied in several ways. Persistent File Anonymization modifies identified discovery layers permanently or creates a copy in file-based data, either by altering the original file or creating an anonymous copy. Dynamic Anonymization changes selected discovery layers dynamically for specific groups or users, allowing different users to see varying levels of data, such as one user seeing a complete document while another sees it with hidden monetary fields or personal data. Database anonymization creates a masked or anonymized copy of a given database, enabling software development teams to work with a masked version.

For Persistent File Anonymization, GEODI creates a copy of the content undergoing masking to perform the process, functioning in a "Mask and Download" manner. This operation can be performed in bulk using the “Batch Mask/Anonymize” action from the Actions menu, which generates a script for system administrators to execute. For a few or individual files, the masking/anonymization feature within the viewer can produce modified copies. Masking operates in formats such as Word (*.doc, *.docx, *.rtf), Excel (*.xlsm, *.csv, *.xlsx, *.xls), PDF (*.pdf), Powerpoint (*.ppt, *.pptx, *.ppsx), and LibreOffice (*.odp, *.odt, *.ods). Masking tools for download are located under a button in the viewers. Masking profiles allow for creating templates to mask all data or specifically PII. For instance, a name like "Hasan Hüseyin" can be masked as "[NAME]" or "****", and different masking formats can be defined for various identifiers like names, IBANs, and currency expressions.

Dynamic Anonymization masks discovery results, making them visible on screens such as the viewer, words, network graph, and summary. Masking in the viewer applies to Office Files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), Open Office (ODT, ODS, etc.), PDF, TXT, and XPS types, regardless of their source (File Server, SharePoint, or Database). To enable this, the "Dynamic Masking" box is selected on the project wizard's last page, and settings are configured, after which files in the project are displayed to users in a masked format. This feature operates with group-based authorization, where a masking metadata is defined for each group, and group members see files in a masked form according to this metadata. The "No Masking" setting displays results without masking for a defined group, and any group or user not matched with a profile is assumed to use the MaskALL profile. When files are downloaded, they are also downloaded in a masked form.

Database masking performs permanent masking on a given database, with the option to work on a copy to preserve the original data. This provides several use cases, such as sharing databases with software or testing teams, where sensitive data is permanently removed. It also enables safe sharing of databases for data analysis by permanently removing sensitive information.

Authorization for masking is equivalent to document download permission, meaning those with download permission can utilize masking. Dynamic masking specifically allows for authorization at both the user and discovery layer levels.

A mask and DISCOVERY license is required for anonymization. The number of users for this feature is equal to the number of GEODI users.
