GEODI projects or their indexes may require backup or synchronization for various reasons. Backing up the index against potential losses is essential for continuous service, as indexing all data takes a long time. GEODI can index changing content, allowing the difference between a backup and the current index to be completed quickly. Daily backup is recommended, and GEODI installations are pre-configured for this, requiring only activation. Additionally, if an Active-Passive disaster recovery configuration is established, an index copy is necessary for rapid failover, using the same backup procedure. More detailed information is available at https://decesw.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/geoditr/pages/3952812220#Aktif-Pasif-FKM-ortam%C4%B1.

The GEODI index is located at `%appdata%\dece\geodi\GeodiIndex2.0`. Since the files in this directory are in continuous use, backup must be performed using a command from the GEODI command script reference. GEODI safely backs up the index to a specified directory while running. However, notes taken and documents added via drag-and-drop after the last backup will be lost. This backup process can be made periodic using the Windows scheduled task infrastructure. Separately, GeodiWS Project files and other settings also need to be synchronized, with instructions provided on the same page: https://decesw.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/geoditr/pages/3952812220#Aktif-Pasif-FKM-ortam%C4%B1.

GEODI commands are found in DCC-extended files, which can be invoked within Batch or PowerShell scripts. An example command is `d.BackupIndex("[Yedeklenecek Hedef Dizin]","[WorkSpace adı]")`, where the target directory and WorkSpace name must be appropriately configured. If multiple WorkSpaces exist, the process must be performed individually for each. A scheduled task can be created using methods like https://forsenergy.com/tr-tr/taskscheduler/html/1a2d9e12-4713-40a9-9c8c-e2ad6316811b.htm. When setting up a task in the Task Scheduler, it is necessary to activate the "Run with highest privileges" option to prevent authorization issues.

GEODI can either repair a damaged index or utilize a backup for recovery. Repairing an index can be time-consuming and may fail depending on the extent of the damage, leaving no alternative but to restart indexing if unsuccessful. Consequently, restoring from a backup (RestoreBackup) is the preferred method. The GEODI Project Wizard's final page, within the advanced settings, offers three distinct options under the "Kurtarma Seçenekleri/Recovery Options" tab.

One recovery option is "Default." With this setting, if corruption is detected in the GEODI Index, a warning appears upon GEODI reopening, and an automatic repair process initiates. The status of this repair can be monitored on the Project Management page. During this process, search and classification operations continue in other projects. Feeding operations via GDE are automatically suspended, with GDE checking every two hours. An "Index Düzeltiliyor" (Index Being Repaired) warning will be displayed in the ES interface for the project undergoing correction.

Another recovery option is "RestoreBackup." When this option is selected, the user must specify the directory where the backup is located. This option utilizes backups created using the previously described method. If the designated backup directory is empty or inaccessible, the system will automatically revert to the "Default" recovery option.

The "DoNothing" recovery option prevents any automatic repair or restoration from a backup. With this choice, the index must be manually corrected. Depending on the damage to the index, it might still be possible to continue with search and other operations, but manual correction is mandatory. The ES interface will indicate that the index is corrupted.
