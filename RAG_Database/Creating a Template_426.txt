A template is a concept created to set how each content will appear on the interfaces.

To implement a template, a subfolder should be created in the `GUI\Custom\ES\Template` folder. This subfolder must be given the name specified for the Template, and a file named `Default.html` should be placed within it.

Templates can be selected by passing `Template=` through the URL. The value transmitted via the URL will be stored in the browser.

A default Template can be specified on a project basis by adding the definition `"Template":" "` under `GenericSettings` in project settings.

The Template concept can be turned off by using the definition `"DisableTemplate":true`.

A single mandatory Template can be defined for use in a project by the definition `"ForceTemplate":" "`. When this definition is made, all other Template determination methods are ignored.

The definition `"Template":" "` can be added under `SystemJSONSettings` to specify the default Template for all projects.

A value of "none" means that a Template is not selected.

`Default.html` can contain `dece-template` or special methods. A Template should only change the document view and should not interfere with other fields on the pages. Colors, Theme, and Order are considered Layout topics.

Html CSS can contain script definitions and can load another CSS or script.

Specific `dece-template` id values and their functions that can be included in `Default.html` are: `geodi-template-default`, used to change the appearance of a single content on the DLV home screen; `geodi-template`, used to change the appearance of a single content on the screen in vertical lists; `geodi-template-hor`, used to change the appearance of a single content on the screen in horizontal lists; `geodi-container-template-default`, used to change the appearance of the Content and the entire list on the DLV main screen; `geodi-container-template`, used to change the appearance of the content and the entire list in vertical lists; and `geodi-container-template-hor`, used to change the appearance of the content and the entire list in horizontal lists.
