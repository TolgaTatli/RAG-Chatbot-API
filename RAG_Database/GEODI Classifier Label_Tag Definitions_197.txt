GEODI Classifier features a flexible labeling mechanism designed to integrate with Data Loss Prevention (DLP) software or an existing labeling schema. It labels PDF, Office, and Libre Office documents, while using ADS (Alternate Data Stream) for all other document types. GEODI directly supports files already tagged by a user's current classification tool and can adapt to an existing label scheme.

Labels used in the standard template and sample files have mandatory first lines, with others being optional, and users can modify or add new ones. Classes are created as described on the "GEODI Classifier - Class and Policy settings" page, and labels must follow a "name:value name:value ..." structure. At least one label must represent the fixed class value, which can take various forms, such as "class:confidential" or "class:{58f30e89-66db-4092-a81f-282a2eee431c}".

Variables can be used inside the tags, and their names are case-sensitive. These variables can represent information such as the computer user name, email sender for OWA, GEODI user for batch classification, the application version (Shell, Office addon, or GEODI), date information in yyyy-mm-dd format, e-poch date values, and UTC full time information. The specific variable may vary depending on the classification tool.

For users without an existing labeling schema, GEODI provides standard default classes and tag definitions. These can be used directly or modified. If no existing tags are present, these default tags can be utilized for DLP compliance.

The "Confidential" class includes labels such as `geodilabelclass:id_classification_secret=2155a213-0150-4c2d-9211-dba2def647fd`, `geodilabeluser:user=%User%`, and `geodilabeltime:datetime=%Date-UTC%`. Its coverage applies to content containing money, specifically amounts greater than 50,000 USD or equivalent, and selected keywords. These selected keywords are stored in a dictionary that users can freely modify.

The "PII" (Personally Identifiable Information) class uses labels like `geodilabelclass:id_classification_personalinfo=d36d9a67-b760-4689-ad88-96381e595636`, `geodilabeluser:user=%User%`, and `geodilabeltime:datetime=%Date-UTC%`. Its coverage includes content with a name or ID combined with a phone number, email, address, or blood type. The term "ID" encompasses National ID numbers, Medical Numbers, and Passports, among others.

The "Restricted" class is defined by labels such as `geodilabelclass:id_classification_restricted=3c9990e0-a748-41de-9d8c-db8783fa5103`, `geodilabeluser:user=%User%`, and `geodilabeltime:datetime=%Date-UTC%`. Its coverage includes IBANs, Tax Numbers, Swift codes, and keywords like "restricted" or "internal use only". These keywords are located in a dictionary that can be freely modified.

The "Unclassifed" class utilizes labels including `geodilabelclass:id_classification_unclassified=0ef0d4bf-59b8-4ae6-bbc0-fafde041157b`, `geodilabeluser:user=%User%`, and `geodilabeltime:datetime=%Date-UTC%`.
