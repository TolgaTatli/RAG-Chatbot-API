GEODI discovers content using two methods: Dictionaries and Recognizers. Dictionaries are predetermined lists of words, including terms such as "Ankara," "Istanbul," "construction," and "purchasing," and can also define synonyms. Recognizers automatically extract information from text, such as Block/Parcel numbers, Kilometers, and Email addresses.

Recognizers and Dictionaries are called Layers in GEODI. GEODI Layers can be added within a Project to allow multidimensional analysis of content. GEODI Dictionaries can be shared with other GEODI users, which centralizes and simplifies installation, standardization, and development.

Dictionaries can be created in several ways. Users can create a dictionary manually without any tools, writing synonyms in a single column separated by commas. It is also possible to import information from different formats like CSV or KML into a dictionary. Existing data in CSV or Shape format can be used directly as a dictionary using the "From File" option.

The GEODI dictionary creation interface includes a "Database" option, which allows establishing a connection with shp, csv, excel, kml, and access files, or MySql, Oracle, SqLite, and Postrgre databases. As long as this connection is not interrupted, GEODI will periodically read updated data to keep the dictionary up to date. Users can match the fields needed for the dictionary with the fields in the data source.

GEODI can keep a linked pattern dictionary up to date by selecting the "Database" dictionary type. MOBIDI can create a dictionary from a database but is not bound to it for updates; it reads the records once and creates the dictionary without this update feature.

Various file formats can be used as GEODI dictionaries. CSV files can be used as GEODI dictionaries. Shape files can be used directly as dictionaries, with their attribute information matched to GEODI dictionary requirements. Excel files (XLS, XLSX) can also be used as dictionaries.

KML files can be used to create many dictionary records at once from multiple geometries, where the name in the KML will be taken as the word. This method allows for the transfer of site plans, and the created data can be edited later. KML data with a single geometry can also be used by copying the relevant geometry from Google Earth and pasting it into the GEODI Dictionary Wizard. This process is useful for transferring information such as road geometry, and if the road geometry is piecemeal, it should be made into a single piece. GEODI uses proportions when calculating mileage, requiring the route to be close to the actual route.

Other supported formats for GEODI dictionaries include Netcad/Netpro Route files (KTB), which are transferred directly if the EPSG code of the project is provided. WKT Format point/line/area geometries are accepted. Geometries obtained from sources such as Google Maps can be imported by copy-paste using the XY option.

To share a user dictionary, it is sufficient to share its ".geodiDictionary" file. These dictionaries are located in the `%APPDATA%\Dece\Geodi\Dictionaries` folder. The file can be saved to the target computer's memory, to a network sharing folder, or shared via HTTP.

To share a file-attached dictionary, both the ".geodiDictionary" file and the files that this dictionary uses must be shared. It is important that the ".geodiDictionary" file is in the same folder as the source files. For example, if a CSV dictionary's ".geodiDictionary" file is shared from "C:\CSV\", its source "denemef.csv" file should also be placed in "C:\CSV\". This applies to sharing dictionaries from a network sharing folder as well.

When sharing Shapefile dictionaries, although a file with the extension ".shp" is specified as the source during creation, other files in the same directory are also used when reading the dictionary. Therefore, when sharing, files such as ".cpg", ".dbf", ".prj", ".sbn", ".sbx", ".xml", and ".shx" must be placed in the same folder as both the ".geodiDictionary" file and the ".shp" file.

Sharing dictionaries over HTTP is largely the same as sharing over a network or by copying files. The difference is that if multiple files are used as the source of the content, such as for Shapefiles, these files need to be compressed into a ZIP file. The ZIP and ".geodiDictionary" files are placed in the same directory on the HTTP server. CSV dictionaries are not shared as ZIP files because they use only a single CSV file as the source.

To share a Shapefile dictionary via HTTP, the ".geodiDictionary" file and the ZIP file containing the compressed source files must be in the same directory. The ZIP file must contain not only the ".shp" file used to create the dictionary but also other files used to read the dictionary, such as ".cpg", ".dbf", ".prj", ".sbn", ".sbx", ".xml", and ".shx". These files should be placed directly under the ZIP file, not in another folder within it. The name of the ZIP file should be "[Shapefile File Name].shp.zip", for example, "GOLBASIYOLORTA.shp.zip" for "GOLBASIYOLORTA.shp".

To add a shared dictionary, open the "Dictionaries" tab and click the "+" "New" button in the upper right corner. Then, click the "From File" button in step 1 of the "Dictionary Wizard." In the dialog box that appears, type the path to the shared ".geodiDictionary" file, which can be on computer memory, in a share folder, or an HTTP connection location. Click "OK." If the file is found and GEODI supports its extension, proceed to step 2. Enter the dictionary name and make other optional settings, then click "Next >>." Optionally change the settings and click the "Close" button. Some dictionaries generated from a file may require column name matching, in which case a warning message will appear before closing.
