GEODI indexes structural data such as databases and Excel. GEODI effectively brings together structural and unstructured data.

Searches within this data can be limited by providing a field name. If the same field name appears in multiple tables, GEODI will search all of them. For a specific table, the table name can be specified using "parent:".

GEODI collects field names itself. Indexing is performed automatically, but users can determine how tables will be indexed using views or other methods if desired.

Structural data can come from different sources. For example, it is used to query PC data coming with GDE (GEODI Desktop Explorer) by IP, Computer Name, or User Name.
