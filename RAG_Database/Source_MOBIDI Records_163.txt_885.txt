GEODI is capable of indexing MOBIDI records.

MOBIDI records can contain various types of location information. This includes the records themselves, individual photographs, and text that GEODI recognizes, such as place names, addresses, or other location details.

A requirement for this functionality is that the MOBIDI office and the GEODI server must be located on the same server.
