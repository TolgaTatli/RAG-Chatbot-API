GEODI is consistently presented with the motto "Ara-Keşfet-Sınıfla-Maskele" (Search-Discover-Classify-Mask). While data discovery often arises in relation to regulations like KVKK or PCI/DSS, GEODI possesses capabilities for data discovery that extend far beyond regulatory requirements. Mapping is identified as one of these advanced features.

Some sectors may question the utility of maps, but the text states that 80% of daily life is connected to location and maps, suggesting numerous benefits. GEODI facilitates greater utilization of maps by automating their preparation, making the process entirely automatic and cost-free.

Map usage is clear and direct for entities such as Municipalities, Construction firms, Architecture offices, Planning units, Project offices, and Real estate units, which often employ GIS software. GEODI enhances their operations by integrating unstructured data. For Digital Forensic professionals, GEODI addresses the need to visualize locations within data, such as where photos were taken or specific addresses mentioned. Regardless of the user's objective, there is no additional cost for the map feature, as maps are automatically generated using artificial intelligence and natural language processing. This capability also paves the way for further analyses, including relationships and heat maps.

Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) frequently operate with limited resources, making the employment of a data analyst challenging. A map can convey substantial information about their suppliers, customers, service points, or stores. Maintaining map or GIS systems typically incurs costs, often requiring skilled operators and manual data entry. With GEODI, the cost is zero, and the map feature complements other functionalities like search and discovery.

An example project named AnkaPedia is accessible via the "canlı projeler" link on the GEODI website. This project leveraged open-source data pertaining to Ankara. The map within AnkaPedia was generated automatically from various sources, including PDF, Word, Excel, DWG, NCZ, Databases, Videos, and Social Media. The map provides extensive information about the data without incurring additional costs when used with GEODI. The text suggests that the data utilized could have originated from an institution's Archive, Invoices, Contracts, Projects, eBYS data, CRM, or ERP databases.

Another example project, "Map of World News," is available on GEODI's English website. This project features a heat map derived from news articles across approximately 100 news sites. Through this heat map, it is possible to perform queries and generate maps related to topics such as Covid or the Ukraine war.

GEODI supports over 200 data sources, ensuring that no digital data is excluded. This includes scanned documents processed via OCR, databases, Word, Excel, Open Office files, emails, UYAP files, videos, and images. Documents such as Invoices, Reports, proposal files, Project files, Specifications, and Contracts can be processed by GEODI without any prior manipulation. The system also allows for the addition of new data sources not explicitly listed.

The information displayed on a GEODI map can vary depending on the user's objective. For a municipality, it might show parcels; for businesses, customer addresses, construction sites, or the locations of service providers. A map can also display city or district names extracted from a report. Any or all of these types of information can be presented on the map.

To find locations related to a specific word, such as "ihracat" (export), a user can type the word into the GEODI search box to display places found in documents containing that term. For more precise results related to the concept of "ihracat," typing "ihracat()" (using the "nearby query" parentheses) is recommended, as this query type yields significant results. The search will return locations associated with "ihracat," and a user can switch to the heat map to identify which locations are more prominent.

Existing company addresses or construction site locations can be converted into a dictionary within minutes. Once these locations are in dictionary format, GEODI can then map documents, emails, or database records based on this information. This process is described as straightforward.

GEODI is compatible with other GIS software, including ArcGIS, GeoServer, and similar applications. It has been developed to support international standards like WMS for this purpose. Additionally, a specific widget is available for ArcGIS Enterprise.
