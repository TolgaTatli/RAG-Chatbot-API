GEODI Discovery is a general-purpose data discovery engine. It can create discovery scopes required by regulations such as KVKK, PCI/DSS, GDPR, or HIPAA, in addition to custom scopes specific to an institution.

Many of these templates are available on DECE-STORE. After the installation phase, the relevant template should be selected from DECE-STORE to proceed.

For personal data discovery, there are packages for different countries. These packages, which contain identity and country-specific identifiers for the country you operate in, are named like Discovery TR/KVKK and Discovery KSA/SAMA/PDPL/CMA.

Data discovery templates will provide ready tools for the discovery scope and reporting of results.

An environment will be created to answer questions that may arise under the Right to Information/Subject Access Request.

You will also be ready for data remediation operations, such as destruction or quarantine, after discovery.
