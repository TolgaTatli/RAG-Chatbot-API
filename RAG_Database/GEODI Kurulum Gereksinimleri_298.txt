GEODI is a web application that users can access via browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. The GEODI Server operates on the user's own servers, ensuring that data does not leave their environment. This document outlines the fundamental components required before installation.

Server features for GEODI include a minimum of 16+ Cores, 32GB+ memory, and 500GB+ disk space. The operating system must be Windows 8 or higher, and .NET Framework 4.0 is required. For high traffic or high CPU usage scenarios like OCR, more memory is recommended. The server can be physical, virtual, or cloud-based, with examples including Azure, Amazon, Natro, and Radore. If FacePro (face recognition) and ImagePro (object recognition) applications are included in the license, CUDA-supported NVIDIA GPU hardware is necessary.

Authorized users or access credentials are required for GEODI installation and operation. This includes a user capable of performing Windows service installations. A user with read-only access to folder data sources and file servers is also needed; file servers can also be indexed with the GDE agent, and a separate user might be required for each server. Access information for databases, emails, and other sources must be prepared before installation, and GEODI stores this information encrypted.

GEODI requires disk space for indexing and for various other purposes depending on user preferences.

Internet access is not mandatory for GEODI. However, specific internet addresses are used for certain functionalities. `servis.dece.com.tr` and `service.decesoftware.com` are utilized for the DECE-STORE and automatic module updates; these addresses are not needed if updates are not desired or if an offline installation is performed. Additionally, `documents.decesoftware.com` and its sub-links are required for GEODI and Agent setup and automatic updates, but are also unnecessary if an offline installation option is used.

GEODI provides several support resources. A general support site for GEODI is available, which teams may need to access. The help desk address is `https://decesupport.atlassian.net/`. Atlassian identity authentication is handled via `https://id.atlassian.com/`. An additional support site, `http://destek.dece.com.tr`, offers online help through Support Q (AI Assistant) and helpdesk access.

For users to access GEODI, an SSL-certified address and an open port, typically 3323 (which can be changed), are required. Users or agents must be able to access GEODI, and depending on their network location, the GEODI address might need to be publicly accessible on the internet. The GEODI Mobile application, available for download from the AppStore or Google Play, also requires the GEODI address to be internet-accessible. If issues arise with GEODI access, users are advised to consult the FAQ page.

GEODI connects to various data sources using numerous data adapters. Detailed information on how to use each adapter can be found on the "GEODI Veri KaynaklarÄ±" page. Before installation, it is recommended to decide which sources to connect to and to have the necessary access information ready for these sources. If data discovery is desired, defining the scope of discovery is important. GEODI includes pre-built recognizers for KVKK, PCI/DSS, country-specific, or institution-specific requirements.

Depending on specific needs, the installation of certain agents may be required for GEODI.

The GEODI Desktop Explorer (GDE) acts as a PC/FileServer discovery agent. GDE is compatible with Windows, Pardus, Linux, and Mac computers. It can operate either as a GEODI login user or as a Windows service. For the installation, updating, or removal of these agents, using tools like ManageEngine or SCCM is recommended. If users need to view files on PCs, port 1982 (which can be changed) must be open on the PC. Files indexed with GDE can be backed up.

The GEODI Classifier is a classification agent that includes Desktop and Microsoft Office agents. The Office Classifier agent functions within Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, while the Desktop Classifier agent operates within Windows Explorer. Both agents are provided in a single package. For their installation, updating, or removal, the use of tools such as ManageEngine or SCCM is recommended. The Microsoft Office Classifier is compatible with MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook versions 2007 and above. The OWA Classifier supports MS Exchange Server 2013 and higher versions, as well as Microsoft Office 365.
