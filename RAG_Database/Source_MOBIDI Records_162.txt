GEODI can index MOBIDI records as well.

MOBIDI records may have different location information. This includes the records themselves, each photograph, and text with place names, addresses, or any other location information GEODI recognizes.

The MOBIDI office and GEODI server must be on the same server.

For detailed information, refer to GEODI Integration.
