GEODI is a GIS solution that includes a robust spatial relations query language. This feature enables users to query unstructured data directly by using words, semantic rules, and spatial relations. This capability is designed to save significant time and resources compared to traditional GIS solutions.

GEODI's rules are designed to find content using geometric words, which include places, points, section numbers, land parcels, roads, addresses, MGRS coordinates, or photographs with GPS. The found content will be displayed on the CONTENT pages, and the associated words will appear on the KEYWORDS page. The map will also show the result.

To query content containing location-related information, users can employ the keyword “geom”. This can include place names like Georgia or London, parcel numbers, and known area codes of phone numbers. These pieces of information contain location references and are visible on the GEODI map.

GEODI's spatial relations query language includes several operators. These operators are bbox, Intersects, Contains, Within, Equals, Touches, Distance, Covers, Overlaps, and CoveredBy. The "Related" operator is defined as a combination of Contains, CoveredBy, and Touches.

The Keywords page normally lists keywords found within the content, but some rules can change this behavior, such as the Word Proximity rule “()” and spatial queries. When the keyword “content” is added to spatial operator keywords, those keywords are also affected by the rule. For example, "Related:Georgia" returns content and displays all keywords from that content on the keyword page, while "RelatedContent:Georgia" returns the same content but limits the spatial keywords shown to those affected by the rule, with non-spatial keywords remaining unaffected.

Spatial queries can use coordinates to define locations. For instance, "Related:42.5,36.4" represents a single longitude and latitude point. "Related:42.5,36.4,43.8,38.5" defines a bounding box using two sets of longitude and latitude. Queries like "Related:42.5,36.4,46.0,36.4,43.2,32.1,42.5,36.4" or "Intersects:"Line 42.5,36.4,46.0,36.4"" can represent an area or a line string using multiple longitude and latitude pairs. For a query to define an area, the first and last coordinates must be identical. Coordinates used in queries must not contain unnecessary blanks.

Spatial queries can also utilize named locations and specify distances. For example, "Touches:"Georgia"" assumes the existence of a spatial city dictionary and a defined geometry for Georgia. "Distance:"Georgia geodistance:50000"" finds content within 50,000 meters. "Within:"Georgia geocenter"" finds documents that cover the Georgia geocenter. Additionally, "Related:"Route66 geobuffer:10"" sets a 10-meter buffer around Route66 to find related content.
