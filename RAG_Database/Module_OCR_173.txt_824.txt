The GEODI OCR module can process scanned documents, images, and videos, making text and Barcode/QRcodes within these data sources searchable. A GEODI OCR Module license is required for its use. The module offers two methods: one using GEODI OCR infrastructure and the other using the ABBYY engine. The ABBYY option may require additional licenses and per-use fees, while the GEODI OCR engine offers better performance and does not require any non-license usage fees.

To set up OCR for specific sources, users must complete the necessary settings for each source they wish to OCR. General OCR settings, which apply to all resources, are configured on the last page of the project wizard. These settings allow users to specify the OCR engine (GEODI or ABBYY) and add additional languages based on the documents' content.

Scanned documents can be converted into Searchable PDF (SPDF) format. SPDF creation requires additional space and time, and when the result is a PDF, the word being searched for is marked on the document. Generating SPDF can increase the total processing time by approximately 50%. OCR for very large documents, such as a Scanned Project, is optional, and barcode and QRCode recognition can also be provided. The Fast OCR feature can save 50%-70% of processing time, though it slightly decreases performance.

The "OCR those that have not been OCRed" command allows for the activation of OCR settings for a scanned project at a later time by initiating the Rescan service for OCR. This enables users to initially scan a project without OCR to save time, then activate OCR settings to process unprocessed items in the background. This command avoids repeated OCR to prevent unnecessary file version increases and can be executed via the user interface or DCC. In the user interface, content to be OCRed can be narrowed by specifying query criteria in the "OCR Unprocessed" field. The command will not allow non-OCR'd files to be OCR'd if OCR settings are not enabled in the project, nor will it allow a new OCR process to start until an OCR repair process is complete. Running the command prompts a confirmation message asking if the user wishes to continue with the background process.

OCR is a time-consuming process that can significantly utilize computer or server resources, especially with a large volume of documents. The fastest processing option involves enabling both SPDF creation and Fast OCR. The success and performance of the OCR process depend on the scan resolution and quality of the documents. Success rates decrease with very old documents like blueprints, skewed pictures taken with a cell phone, or skewed images such as an incompletely opened book. The C++ Runtime 2015-2019 package must be installed in the environment where the GEODI OCR module will run.

The OCR module includes technical settings that can be configured in the `OCRSettings.json` file, located in the `GEODI/Settings/Geodi.OCR` directory. If no settings have been made, this file will have a `.sample` extension, which must be deleted before saving it with a `.json` extension. Content written in this file must adhere to JSON rules, and GEODI requires a restart for these changes to take effect. Specific settings include `"NoSpellCheck"` (true/false) for correcting misspelled words using GEODI dictionaries, `"NoConnectedWordCheck"` (true/false) to preserve the meaning of hyphenated words at the end of a line, and `"NoEnhance"` (true/false) to correct defects in documents and place found characters on the original page.

The `"Quality"` value in the OCR settings relates to the quality of images within the document and does not alter the OCR quality itself. A higher `"Quality"` value results in increased OCR time and a larger SPDF size. The `"MaxPageCount"` setting, with a default of 64, limits the number of pages to be OCRed. Only the first 64 pages are processed, with subsequent pages added as they are. Increasing this value will lead to longer processing times.

Training for GEODI users covers the definition of OCR, its impact on search performance, and user expectations. It includes reviewing document samples for OCR, such as good documents, dirty documents, documents taken with a cell phone, documents between books, and barcode/QRCode samples. The training also addresses photo and video OCR, explaining that the process occurs automatically via drag and drop or other data addition methods, and emphasizes awareness of OCR process performance and barcode recognition.

Training for GEODI administrators focuses on the differences between GEODI-OCR and ABBYY, highlighting GEODI OCR's advantages like better performance and no price per transaction. It covers that OCR requires processing power and that OCRing everything initiates a long process. The training includes OCR setup, activating OCR and barcode recognition for a source in a GEODI Project, and general OCR settings. Specific topics include the FastOCR setting (speed, how to make, impact), the SPDF setting (capability, how to make, benefit, what happens without it, impact), and the decision to delete or not delete TIFFs for space saving, as they are not necessary after OCR.

Further topics for GEODI administrators include barcode recognition, OCR with videos, mask application for removing camera traces and eliminating edges, and details that can be captured with video OCR. It is noted that SPDF creation does not occur for TIFF files containing geometric information (GeoTIFFs). Administrators also need awareness of the SPDF directory and metafile, and the process of OCR in different languages.
