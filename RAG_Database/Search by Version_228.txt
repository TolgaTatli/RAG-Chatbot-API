GEODI searches for given criteria across all sources connected to your project.

GEODI automatically versions content without requiring any settings. By default, all versions are included in queries.

To limit the versions included in queries, the “ver:” keyword should be used. Versioning happens in the index, and GEODI does not store previous versions as files.

The “backup content” option can be activated to store old versions. A new version is created if a discovery finds content with a different timestamp, whether it is a file or any other type. A new version is also created if a user adds a document by drag-and-drop.

Specific uses of the “ver:” keyword include: “ver:last” for the last version, “ver:0” for old versions, “ver:” for a specific version, and “ver:[prev | hasprev]” for one older version.
