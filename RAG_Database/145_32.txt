A mechanism exists to address the need for files scanned with 145 GDE to be removed from the project interface after they have been removed from the computer.

These operations are performed via the Aksiyonlar (Actions) menu. The 'Silinenleri Sil' (Delete Deleted Ones) action will address the need. A new version update may be required for the operation to work.
