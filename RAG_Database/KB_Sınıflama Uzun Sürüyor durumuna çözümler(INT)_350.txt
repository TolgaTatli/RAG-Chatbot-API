SD-2744 indicates that PDF classification is slow and its states cannot be measured on-site. There is a tendency to attribute this issue to GEODI due to a lack of trust and learned helplessness, but a simple test suggests the problem lies more with the environment than with GEODI itself.

Before further investigation, it is necessary to demonstrate what is occurring on "our server" using the PoC Classifier. If data privacy concerns arise, a new document can be created, and the only exception to this process is if the system is not open to the internet.

When addressing the issue of a web service returning late, it is advised to assume that customer IT teams are competent and to avoid interfering with their work. The provided information is intended to facilitate a reasonable and informed response to the other party, rather than prompting direct intervention. It is crucial not to assume the role of the other party's IT team, as there are numerous potential causes for delays besides GEODI, with 99% of causes stemming from these external factors.

When a web service returns responses later than expected, several factors can contribute to the delay. These include network latency, which is the time data takes to travel between the client and server, and server load, where heavy loads can slow request processing due to resource limitations or inefficient server-side implementation.

Other technical causes for web service delays involve the Content-Length Header, which, if missing or incorrect in a POST request, can lead to processing delays. HTTP Status Codes in the 500-599 range indicate server-side issues that require troubleshooting. Long polling techniques can also cause apparent delays even if data is processed immediately, due to the time taken to close the connection.

Client-side code should be evaluated by measuring the time spent preparing responses and considering message sizes, with profiling helping to pinpoint bottlenecks. In Angular applications, ensuring observable subscriptions are within appropriate lifecycle hooks, such as `ngOnInit`, is important, as late function invocation can be related to these subscriptions. Troubleshooting delays requires analyzing both client-side and server-side components, and tools like Fiddler can assist in diagnosing HTTP time statistics and identifying potential issues. If server access is available, monitoring its performance and investigating bottlenecks is recommended.

Fiddler is a widely used web debugging proxy tool that enables tracking and inspection of HTTP and HTTPS traffic between a computer and the internet. It is valuable for identifying and resolving bugs in both web and desktop applications.

Wireshark is a powerful network protocol analyzer that captures and allows interactive browsing of traffic on computer networks. Unlike Fiddler, which focuses on HTTP and HTTPS, Wireshark can analyze any type of network packet, making it suitable for diagnosing issues at various levels, including below the HTTP layer. It is free, open-source, and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Charles is an HTTP proxy, monitor, and reverse proxy that enables developers to view all HTTP and SSL/HTTPS traffic between their machine and the internet, including requests, responses, and headers. It is popular for iPhone and iPad development but also functions on other platforms.

mitmproxy is an SSL-capable man-in-the-middle proxy for HTTP, offering a console interface for inspecting and editing traffic in real-time. It is open source and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, making it a suitable choice for intercepting and analyzing HTTPS traffic. Proxyman is a modern alternative to Fiddler, designed specifically for macOS, providing features like intercepting and modifying requests, viewing responses, and debugging APIs. While not free, it offers a polished user experience for Apple platform developers. OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an open-source security tool primarily focused on finding vulnerabilities in web applications, but it can also be used for debugging purposes, including intercepting and modifying requests and scanning for security issues.

Each of these tools possesses distinct strengths and weaknesses, and the selection should be based on specific needs. These alternatives provide robust solutions for debugging, monitoring, or analyzing network traffic, extending capabilities beyond those offered by a browser's built-in inspector.

Among the discussed tools, Proxyman is identified as one of the easiest to deploy, particularly for macOS users. Its design for macOS ensures seamless integration, and it features a clean, intuitive interface that simplifies setup and usage. Proxyman focuses specifically on HTTP and HTTPS requests, which streamlines its purpose compared to tools that capture all network traffic. It also offers SSL decryption for inspecting HTTPS traffic and allows for easy proxy configuration of systems or applications, further simplifying deployment. Although it is a paid tool, a free trial period is available for evaluation.

The ease of deployment for these tools can vary depending on the user's familiarity with the tool and their specific use case. For users comfortable with command-line tools and requiring broader network analysis capabilities, Wireshark or mitmproxy are options. However, for macOS users, Proxyman is presented as a solid choice.
