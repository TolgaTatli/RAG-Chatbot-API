There are two ways to index or discover file servers.

If a network share is available, the "Source:Folder" method can be used to index or discover file servers.

Alternatively, if there is no network share or if the GEODI Service user permissions are insufficient, the GDE agent can be used as a service. For more information on this method, users should refer to the "GEODI Desktop Explorer(GDE) Installation" guide.
