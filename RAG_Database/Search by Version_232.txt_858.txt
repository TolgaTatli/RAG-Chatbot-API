GEODI searches for given criteria across all sources connected to your project.

GEODI automatically versions content without requiring any settings. By default, all versions are included in queries. To limit the versions included in queries, the “ver:” keyword should be used.

Versioning occurs in the index, and GEODI does not store previous versions as files. Users can activate the “backup content” option to store old versions as files.

A new version is created if a discovery finds content with a different timestamp, regardless of whether it is a file or another type. Additionally, a new version is created if a user adds a document by drag-and-drop.

The “ver:” keyword supports specific values for querying versions: “ver:last” refers to the last version, “ver:0” refers to old versions, “ver:” refers to a specific version, and “ver:[prev | hasprev]” refers to one older version.
