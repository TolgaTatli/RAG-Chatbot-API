GEODI operates with the motto Search-Discover-Classify-Mask. While data discovery is frequently associated with regulations like KVKK or PCI/DSS, GEODI provides capabilities beyond the discovery required for these regulations. GEODI specializes in uncovering hidden value within data through various methods. The act of discovery itself is beneficial, enabling users to better understand data leakage risks, comprehend data needing protection, and enhance overall security.

The network graph is a tool designed to reveal deeper relationships within data, uncovering insights not apparent from lists or documents alone. This tool is beneficial for various professionals, including lawyers, press advisors, independent auditors, inspectors, experts, managers, and individuals involved in digital forensics. The network graph tools are easy to use, and their results are effective.

A network graph is composed of nodes connected by lines, similar to a road network. Within the GEODI network graph, nodes specifically represent words, which are the discoveries made, or documents. The lines in the GEODI network graph illustrate the relationships between these nodes. This network graph functionality is included as part of the GEODI Discovery package.

Network graph analysis is a complex process. Since GEODI conducts data discovery at terabyte and petabyte levels, it is not feasible to visualize all relationships in a single graph due to the lack of an understandable visual and performance constraints. While GEODI's general performance applies to the network graph within physical limits, users should narrow down the data to achieve meaningful results. GEODI adjusts the visual for clarity, and users can stop or restart the process by altering the query. The network graph initially loads data at one or two levels, with options to load additional levels. The process may occasionally strain the computer, requiring some time.

Navigation within the network graph is similar to using a map, allowing users to zoom in and out with the mouse wheel to enlarge areas of interest. Right-clicking on any node provides access to associated documents and properties. To load an additional level of data in the network graph, users can utilize the expand function.

Document-Word Relationships analysis addresses what is discovered within a document. In this analysis, documents are central, with elements like names, dates, places, and credit cards linked by lines within the document. If an identical name appears in a different document, it connects to the same node, enabling the tracking of relationships across documents. Users can refine discovery results in the facet area to display only names and credit cards. Deeper analyses can be conducted using proximity operators.

Word-Document Relationships analysis is the inverse of Document-Word analysis. In this type of analysis, a name is positioned at the center, with connections extending to all documents where that specific name is present.

In Word-Word analysis, documents are not directly involved but serve as an indirect link. Words that appear within the same document are connected to one another. The nature of this linkage can vary.

GEODI supports over 200 data sources, ensuring comprehensive coverage of digital data. It processes scanned documents using OCR technology and integrates with various file types, including databases, Word, Excel, Open Office files, emails, UYAP files, videos, and images. This broad capability allows GEODI to process invoices, reports, proposals, project files, specifications, and contracts without exception. New data sources can always be added to GEODI's supported list.
