GEODI Reports can be accessed through the search interface by clicking on the three dots. These reports, and additional ones, can also be accessed using the API. GEODI Report services are capable of being utilized as user-defined web services, provided appropriate definitions are in place.

The Report REST API allows for the retrieval of reports defined within GEODI. The format of the returned result varies based on the report type. For instance, a GeoJSON report will return JSON, while other report types might return HTML, CSV, or Excel. Up-to-date methods for this API are available at `https://servis2.dece.com.tr/geodiexporthandler?op=.wsdl&loginWithGuest=1`.

Requests to the Report REST API use the URL format `[GEODIURL]/GeodiExportHandler?op=ExportQueryResult&ReportID=[raporun IDsi]&st_wsName=[WSNAME]&st_query=[StrorageManagerQueryOptions_JSON]&languagetemp=[en-US|tr-tr|..]&UserSession=[TOKEN]`. Key parameters include `wsName` (string, name of the workspace), `ReportID` (the ID of the report), and `languagetemp` (specifies the ISO code for the report language, e.g., `en-US` or `tr-tr`). The `query` parameter is a JSON object where a specific property is sufficient for most searches, and query syntax details are found in "GEODI Query Rules".

GenericSettings options for the Report REST API include a setting that, if true, prevents the report from being listed in the GUI. These settings are added to the `FillOptions` value and can function as a key/value collection providing URL parameters for certain REST API methods. They can also disable delayed results utilized in some reports. The supported HTTP methods for this API are GET and POST.

Expected error codes for the Report REST API include 401 (Unauthorized access / Access denied), 403 (Forbidden), 511 (Network Authentication Required), 501 (Server Error / Untrusted Request), 204 (No Content), and 408 (Unknown Workspace). The return value of the API depends on the report type; for example, a GeoJSON report returns JSON, while others may return HTML, CSV, or XLSX.

An example request for the Report REST API is `https://service.decesoftware.com/GeodiExportHandler?op=ExportQueryResult&ReportID=GeoJSON&st_wsName=Sample Project&st_query={FillOptions:128}&languagetemp=en-US&UserSession=[Token]`. Users should replace the `https://service.decesoftware.com` address with their specific GEODI address when making requests.

The Custom Service Report API differs from the standard Report REST API in that its results can be similar to GEODI views. The behavior of this API is modified by the `queryMode` parameter. Up-to-date methods for this API are available at `https://servis2.dece.com.tr/geodiexporthandler?op=.wsdl&loginWithGuest=1`.

Requests to the Custom Service Report API use the URL format `[GEODIURL]/GeodiExportHandler?op=Export2&queryMode=[DLV|KLV|..]&ReportID=[raporun IDsi]&wsName=[WSNAME]&query=[StrorageManagerQueryOptions_JSON]&languagetemp=[en-US|tr-tr|..]&UserSession=[TOKEN]`. Parameters such as `wsName`, `ReportID`, `query`, and `languagetemp` function identically to those in the standard Report REST API. GenericSettings options are also the same as in the previous API.

The `queryMode` parameter in the Custom Service Report API accepts several values that define its behavior. `DLV` behaves like DLV and returns a `d` object, specifically a `QueryGeodiContentReference`. `KLV` works with KLV query results, also returning a `d` object (`QueryGeodiContentReference`). `SUMMARY` works with Summary query results, returning a `d` object (`SummaryServiceResult`). Other query modes include `QUERY_DOCUMENTS`, `QUERY_KEYWORDS`, and `QUERY_SUMMARY`, which are described as very simple, plain queries without REST API attachments, each returning a `d` object (`QueryGeodiContentReference`). If `querymode` is empty, it defaults to `GeodiEntry`.

Expected error codes for the Custom Service Report API include 401 (Unauthorized access / Access denied), 403 (Forbidden), 511 (Network Authentication Required), 501 (Server Error / Untrusted Request), 204 (No Content), and 408 (Unknown Workspace). The return value of this API depends on the report type; for example, a GeoJSON report returns JSON, while others may return HTML, CSV, or XLSX. The supported HTTP methods for this API are GET and POST.

An example request for the Custom Service Report API is `https://service.decesoftware.com/GeodiExportHandler?op=Export2&queryMode=DLV&ReportID=DocumentReport&wsName=Sample Project&query={startIndex:2,endIndex:4}&languagetemp=tr-tr&UserSession=[TOKEN]`. Users should replace the `service.decesoftware.com` address with their specific GEODI address when making requests.

A sample report configuration is provided in JSON format, defining a report with an `ID` of "Sample1" and a `__type` of "Factory.ActionFactory:HTMLReporter". This configuration specifies `DisableDownload` and `DisableWaitConnectionCheck` as true, sets the `DisplayName` to "Sample1", `ForcedExtension` to ".json", and `DefaultContentType` to "text/json". Its `GenericSettings` include `QueryMode` as "DLV", `FillOptions` as 33554432, `QueryStringParams` with `FillLayerNames` set to "1", and `HideClient` as true. The configuration also contains an HTML-like template for extracting content, content ID, version, recognizer, UNC path, content type, modified date, source, computer name, and IP.
