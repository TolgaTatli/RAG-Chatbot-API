GEODI is a web application that users access through an internet browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. The GEODI Server operates on your servers, ensuring that data remains within your environment.

Basic installation requirements for the GEODI Server include 16+ Cores, 32GB+ Memory, and 500GB+ Disk space. It runs on Windows 8 and above, and requires .NET Framework 4.0. More processing power is beneficial for extensive OCR requirements. The server can be a physical, virtual, or cloud-based instance, including platforms like Azure or Amazon. For FacePro or ImagePro functionalities, CUDA-supported NVIDIA GPU hardware is a specific requirement.

Authorized users and credentials are necessary for GEODI. For Windows Service Installation, a user account with read-only access rights is required for Folder Data sources or File servers. File servers can be indexed using a GDE agent as a Windows service, and each server might need a distinct user. Credentials for databases, e-mails, and other data sources should be prepared before installation, and GEODI stores this information in an encrypted format.

GEODI requires storage for its Index and, depending on preferences, for other purposes. Internet access is not mandatory, as GEODI can be configured for offline and on-premise operation. However, accessing addresses like service.decesoftware.com and servis.dece.com.tr (for DECE-STORE) simplifies management and updates by enabling GEODI to automatically update modules and configuration materials. If an offline model is chosen, updates are still possible but necessitate manual intervention by your teams. Additionally, documents.decesoftware.com and its sub-links are used for GEODI and Agents setup, as well as auto-updates of new versions.

GEODI requires an SSL-certified address and the default port 3323 to be open, though this port is subject to change. The accessibility of the GEODI address from the internet depends on the location of the clients, which include both users and agents. The GEODI Mobile app, available for download from the AppStore or Google Play, requires internet access to connect to GEODI.

GEODI features many data adapters, with a dedicated page explaining how to connect each data source. While data sources can be added or deleted at any time, it is suggested to determine the data sources and have access credentials ready prior to installation. For data discovery, defining the discovery scope is important. GEODI provides hundreds of recognizers and tools for various discovery purposes, including GDPR, PCI/DSS, HIPAA, Finance, country-specific, or custom discovery.

Your GEODI configuration may require the installation of agents, such as the PC/FileServer crawling agent known as GEODI Desktop Explorer (GDE). GDE is available in different packages for Windows, Linux, and Mac computers, and can operate either in the login user space or as a service. Tools like ManageEngine or SCCM are suggested for installing, updating, or removing these agents. If a user needs to open or view a file from a PC, port 1982 (or another chosen port) must be open on the client machines.

The GEODI Classifier family includes agents for Desktop and Microsoft Office Classification, all provided in a single package. The Office Classifier agent functions with Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, while the Desktop Classifier agent works with Windows Explorer. Compatibility for the Microsoft Office Classifier extends to MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook 2007 and above. The OWA Classifier is compatible with MS Exchange Server 2013 and above, and Microsoft Office 365. ManageEngine or SCCM are suggested tools for installing, updating, or removing these agents.
