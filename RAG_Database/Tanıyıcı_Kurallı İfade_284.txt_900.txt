A "Kurallı ifade tanıyıcı" (Rule-based expression recognizer) operates according to a rule determined by the user. It helps to select and separate parts described using a formal language within texts. The user determines the outcome it will yield. This usage is generally known as "Regex" and is a common practice.

To obtain information about Regex and test prepared regex expressions, the ".NET Regex Tester" website can be used.

When preparing regex expressions, care should be taken to use uppercase letters because Geodi converts and uses words in uppercase.

An example regex, `[0-9,\,]+X[0-9,\,]+X[0-9,\,]*[ ]*CM|[0-9,\,]+X[0-9,\,]+[ ]*CM`, can be used to find dimension expressions in documents. Examples include "25X25cm" or "5x10x12,5 cm".

Another regex example, `[0-9]+[ ]*SAYFA|[0-9]+[ ]*ADET`, can be used to find page and quantity numbers in documents. Examples include "10 Sayfa, 20 Adet".

The regex `MIL-STD-[0-9]*[A-Z]*` is used to identify terms that specify military standards globally. Examples that can be captured with this regex include "MIL-STD-1376" and "MIL-STD-1246C".

The regex `(HTTPS?://)?(WWW[.])?([Iİ]NSTAGRAM[.]COM)(([/?#][^\s]*)|\s+)` recognizes Instagram addresses and supports different writing styles. Examples include "https://www.instagram.com/deceyazilim/", "www.instagram.com/deceyazilim/", and "instagram.com/deceyazilim/".

In addition to rules, custom validation algorithms can be written, such as those based on close words, Luhn validation, or Verhoef validation.

To better analyze the results, the "Kelimeler" (Words) page can be used.

When preparing a regex expression, it is important to ensure there are no spaces at the beginning or end of the expression.

To use this recognizer, possession of a Geodi Pro license and module is required.
