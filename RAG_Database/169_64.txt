A classification feature for Linux and MacOS is included in the roadmap. This feature will be implemented as a tool that operates solely through the shell.

Classification can be performed in Fileorbis. Fileorbis stores its data within the filesystem, which enables direct access for an authorized user.

In situations where direct access for discovery is not feasible, low-code definitions can be created for resources that provide a web API or a similar type of API.

A classification method that operates internally within Fileorbis is not currently part of the roadmap.
