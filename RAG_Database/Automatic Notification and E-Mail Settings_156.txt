The Automatic Notification Messages feature provides two basic monitoring capabilities. Users can monitor desired queries and receive automatic notifications when query results change, such as when a new document is added. Additionally, users can send messages to individuals mentioned in their notes, facilitating easy sharing of notes with team members.

In the default setup, users are limited to saving and sharing their queries. To fully utilize the Automatic Notification Messages feature, specific definitions are required. Users must possess an e-mail address, with LDAP users utilizing e-mail settings from Active Directory. Furthermore, the user must click the “Save and Watch the Query” button, and the “Watch” option must be selected within the project.

GEODI employs an e-mail infrastructure for notification and user settings. If these settings are left blank, notifications will be delivered via a DECE Gmail account. To customize notifications to originate from an organization's e-mail, settings can be accessed via GEODI/Manager/Settings/e-Mail. The server address and port number will vary based on the mail server used, with Microsoft Office 365 provided as an example. The sender display name can be set as desired, which users will see as the sender, though some servers may not allow the image name.

After creating e-mail settings, they should be tested and saved only after confirming functionality, as incorrect e-mail definitions will prevent notifications. It is necessary to update these settings if the password of the associated account changes. For links within e-mails to function correctly, the ServerUri URL must be defined, as described in System Configuration - Security Settings, with an example being `{"ServerUri":"http://servis2.dece.com.tr"}`.
