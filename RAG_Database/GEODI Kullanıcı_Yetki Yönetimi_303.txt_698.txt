User creation, permission assignment, and group definition are managed through the “/Ayarlar/Kullanıcı ayarları/Yetki Yönetimi” path. On this page, the "Gruplar" tab allows for the management of groups and their associated permissions, while the "Kullanıcılar" tab is used to define users, send messages, and associate users with groups.

Within the "Gruplar" section, the "Sistem yöneticisi" (System Administrator) role can create users and groups, and add or remove users from groups. GEODI permissions are assigned to groups. It is recommended to create a minimum of "GEODI Kullanıcıları" (GEODI Users), "GEODI Yöneticileri" (GEODI Managers), and "GEODI Sistem Yöneticileri" (GEODI System Administrators) groups. The number of group members is specified, and a single user can be a member of multiple groups.

GEODI supports LDAP/Active Directory integration. For this integration, the machine where GEODI is installed must be within the same domain. If LDAP groups are to be added, they can be incorporated by creating a corresponding group within GEODI.

GEODI automatically utilizes the permissions of LDAP group members. Management for users originating from LDAP occurs on the Active Directory side. Changes to passwords stored in LDAP affect GEODI, and users deleted from LDAP will also be unable to access GEODI.

LDAP users are added by matching them with groups; when a username is typed, if a similar name exists in LDAP, it is offered as an option, simplifying management in networks with many LDAP users. LDAP users appear in the format `domain\username`, and their management is entirely on the AD side, thus no additional options are provided within GEODI. GEODI Notification services use the email addresses defined in AD for LDAP users.

Folder and file-based permissions granted in Active Directory are utilized by GEODI. GEODI cannot override restrictions set in AD but can impose new ones. To use folder permissions granted in AD, the `SupportLDAPPermissions` setting must be set to `true` within the `ContentReadereEnumerators` section of the project detail settings.

When GEODI scans different shared areas and users can see different shared areas, and if Share and File permissions do not intersect, or Group permissions and builtin settings do not intersect, GEODI should access shares as the end-user would to avoid issues. It is advised not to give GEODI a single general folder for searching or to use certain settings unnecessarily, as this can lead to the loss of restrictions provided by share permissions and allow unauthorized users to access content. This setting should only be used where no definitions are made with share permissions, and all access permissions are managed through file/folder permissions.

Under Enumerator or Project GenericSettings, `LDAPUseDriveSharePermissions` has a default value of `true` and can be disabled by setting it to `false`. Similarly, `LDAPUseBuiltinPermissions` also defaults to `true` and can be disabled by setting it to `false`. When these settings are changed, re-scanning is not required; the "Yetkileri Düzenle" (Edit Permissions) option applies the new settings to existing content.

In "Yetkileri Yönet" (Manage Permissions), the specific permissions to be used for each group are determined. Permission categories can vary based on installed modules; for example, the MOBIDI Connector application module adds categories related to MOBIDI Office. Permissions are granted to groups, and the permissions of users added to or removed from groups are automatically updated after a certain period. If an immediate update is desired, the "Yetkileri Düzenle" option on the GEODI Project scanning screen can be used to re-read added or removed permissions.

If no selections are made for any group, it is interpreted as having no authorization, and the permission button will display an open lock icon.

Users can originate from LDAP/AD or be GEODI-specific users. Management of LDAP users is handled on the AD side, and changes made in AD (such as email or password) may take 10-30 minutes to reflect in GEODI, during which old information remains valid. Newly added users can be sent an invitation email if their email address is defined. Users who forget their password can request a new one from the login page.

If the license permits, guest user definitions can be used to create publicly accessible GEODI projects. Guest users offer a practical solution for information-sharing projects, such as digital city archives or treasury ministry projects. Guest users must be activated from the Settings, included in a group, and assigned appropriate permissions for the project. They will appear as "guest" in the user list.

GEODI can integrate with identity authentication sources like Google and Facebook, allowing users to log in using these sources. Pre-defined configurations exist for Google, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Microsoft; their definitions can be found in the `[directory]` and activated by changing their extensions to `.jSettings`. Activated sources will appear on the login page. Permissions for users from these sources must be separately defined by including them in a group. To grant permissions to all users from a source like Google, select the desired group and enter "*" for users while choosing Google. Alternatively, entering a specific user's email address instead of "*" will grant permissions only to that individual user.

GEODI's infrastructure is suitable for external user authentication services beyond LDAP and can integrate with other platforms used by institutions. Providing the services specified at `developers.dece.com.tr` is sufficient for integration. Additionally, GEODI can integrate with user authentication features of services like Facebook and Google.

Project-specific permissions are defined for GEODI projects. If no permission is assigned to any group, all users will possess all permissions. These project-based permissions include: "Projeyi Görebilir" (View Project), which determines which groups can see the project; "Projeyi Düzenleyebilir" (Edit Project), which grants permission to make changes in the project; "Projeyi Indeksleyebilir" (Index Project), which is the permission for scanning the project from scratch or scanning changes; "Projeyi Silebilir" (Delete Project), which is the project deletion permission, and if this permission is absent, the delete button will not be visible; "Rapor Alabilir" (Generate Report), which allows for the generation of export reports related to the project; and "Veri Operatörü" (Data Operator), which is the permission to tag and group results recognized by modules like FacePro and TextPro.

Resource-based authorizations can be implemented within a project. If no permission is assigned to any group, all users will have all permissions. These resource-based permissions include: "Arayabilir" (Search), which determines who can see the relevant resource; "Paylaşabilir" (Share), which enables sharing from a Twitter account defined in GEODI; "Görüntüleyebilir/İndirebilir" (View/Download), which allows authorized users to download and view files within the relevant resource; "Not Ekleyebilir" (Add Note), which is the permission to add notes to files and folders in the relevant resource; "Başkalarının Notlarını Düzenleyebilir" (Edit Others' Notes), which grants permission to modify other users' notes; and "Ekleyebilir/Besleyebilir" (Add/Feed), which allows uploading files to the relevant resource via the browser.

To view the permissions of a logged-in user in GEODI and clear the permission cache, the following steps can be applied: Navigate to the Api → User Manager Api section. To view the permissions of the currently logged-in user, click [RUN] next to `UserInfoFull` and `GetCurrentUserInfoWithPermissions()`. To clear the permission cache, click [RUN] next to `Boolean` and `ClearCurrentUserPermissionCache()`; this can be used for immediate reflection of permission changes.

To limit or override SystemAdmin Superuser Permissions, which by default grant System Administrators privileged access and the ability to view all content, this setting can remove System Administrator privileges. This setting will apply to all workspaces. In the `SystemSettings` file, the value can be set to `TRUE` (default is `FALSE`). Further details are available on the `https://destek.dece.com.tr/space/PAR/87209813/Sistem+Yapılandırma+ve+Güvenlik+Ayarları` page.

After limiting SystemAdmin privileges, it is necessary to set the required permissions for each data source. For example, a DPO group's members might be able to open, report, and review all findings, while System Administrators cannot, assuming the resource name is SG-43; this process must be repeated for other resources. It is important to note that when all checkboxes are unchecked, all tools are open (an initial state), but once a box is checked, permissions behave as expected, requiring individual permission grants.
