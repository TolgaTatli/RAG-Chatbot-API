GEODI can scan existing email inboxes. It automatically indexes email content and attachments, making both the email body and attachments searchable.

GEODI supports the automatic indexing of *.PST and *.OST files. It can also index emails from servers that use IMAP or POP3 protocols.

For Exchange Server, GEODI can index all users' emails if a user has access permission to other users' email addresses. The EWS service must be enabled on the Exchange Server for this feature.

Users can view indexed emails based on their permissions if they are listed in the From, To, CC, or BCC fields.
