This MSI package contains Classifier Desktop, which includes a Shell Extension, and Microsoft Office add-ons.

The GEODI Classifier SETUP tab automatically generates the necessary parameters. Installation can be performed manually or by utilizing a deployment tool such as ManageEngine.

Office add-ons cannot be disabled or removed by users; only system administrators have the capability to perform these actions.

Installed agents are monitored using an Agent Management Panel, which is described within GEODI.

Installation conditions include the requirement for a GEODI Workspace dedicated to Classification policies. Additionally, the GEODI URL address must be accessible from all endpoints. For deployments across multiple PCs, a tool like ManageEngine, SCCM, or PDQ is necessary.

The Classifier Agent can be located at the address /GUI/Agents/Classifier.

MSI parameters are provided for informational purposes, as the GEODI Classifier SETUP tab automatically generates them.

The GEODI_URL parameter specifies the address that agents will use to access GEODI. A secure and named address, such as one using DNS or SSL, is recommended for this parameter.

The GEODI_WSNAME parameter defines the name of the GEODI Workspace where policies are established. Agents will use this parameter to update policies.

The GEODI_TOKEN parameter represents a token generated within Classification Settings. It is recommended to create a separate user for this token, as the token user password should not be changed.

Commands for agent deployment can be utilized with tools such as PDQ, ManageEngine, or SCCM.

For setup, the command is "GEODI.Classifier.msi" /quiet GEODI_URL="https://.." GEODI_WSNAME="ClassifierWorkspace" GEODI_TOKEN=. The GEODI Classifier SETUP tab automatically generates these parameters.

To uninstall the agent, the command msiexec.exe /x "GEODI.Classifier.msi" /qn /norestart can be used.

The update command is start "" "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\DECE Software\GEODI Classifier\Updater.exe". Normally, this command is not required because agents update themselves automatically.

Agents automatically check for updates every two days and update themselves from the GEODI server, eliminating the need for user intervention.
