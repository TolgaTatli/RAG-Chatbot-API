GEODI SETUP 8.0.138, released on October 17, 2024, includes updated default values based on user feedback. Performance speed is now at its highest level. Unrecognized file extensions, previously ignored, will now be indexed by file name. MDB and file-based databases will be indexed by name by default, with a required module available from DECE-STORE for exploring tables and rows.

Maintenance tools, such as those for updating permissions, have been accelerated in GEODI SETUP 8.0.138.

GEODI SETUP 8.0.137, released on September 16, 2024, introduces the ability to query for file names and file contents. Users can now search by specifying either just the content or just the file name, a capability usable in searches or classifications. This feature is related to GEODI Query Rules.

GEODI SETUP 8.0.137 allows for the compression of old indexes. Due to new index improvements, the GEODI index structure has become more compact, and this version enables compressing old discovery and search indexes to transition them to the new structure.

In GEODI SETUP 8.0.137, it is possible to modify default auto-classification rules using new dictionaries. There are two dictionaries for the Confidential and Restricted classes, and any additions, deletions, or modifications to these dictionaries will impact the classification rules. These dictionaries can be accessed under the Classification tab on the GEODI dictionaries page, where entries can be managed as needed. This functionality is part of GEODI Classifier - Class and Policy settings.

GEODI SETUP 8.0.137 enhances the name recognizer, a critical feature of GEODI NLP, to cover more languages. Numerous improvements have been made to recognize names, with the most significant being the recognition of names in additional languages, which is crucial for discovery and classification from unstructured data.

GEODI SETUP 8.0.137 ensures consistent behavior for digits across all languages. Regardless of the alphabet or language a number is written in, GEODI now processes it the same way, applying to ID numbers, dates, or any other text containing a digit.

GEODI SETUP 8.0.137 adds a ready `SourceCode` query. The `predefined:SourceCode` query lists all source code files and supports extensions for well-known languages. To use this query, the module must be installed from DECE-STORE.

GEODI SETUP 8.0.137 includes a ready `CV` query. The `predefined:CV` query searches various CV documents based on their content. It currently supports English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindu, Urdu, and Turkish languages.

GEODI Setup 8.0.135, released on August 9, 2024, introduces new Country and Regulation Templates. The discovery scope has been significantly enhanced, and the performance for each country has improved. Templates are now available for each country and regulation, allowing users to select a template to begin discovery. This feature is part of GEODI Discovery. Additionally, DECE-STORE can now be searched using regulation names such as GDPR, SAMA, or PDPL.

GEODI Setup 8.0.135 allows for limiting System Administrators' permissions. System Administrators no longer need to be superusers; their access to projects can be restricted, preventing them from viewing content and discovery results, and enabling them to solely manage the system. More information is available via a provided URL.

GEODI Setup 8.0.135 features improved LDAP Support and new queries. Enhancements have been made to LDAP file permissions, and it is now possible to query documents based on whether a particular user and group can view them. These queries can also be utilized for classification, for instance, to classify a document as confidential if a specific group has access to it. This functionality is further detailed under GEODI Query Rules.

GEODI Setup 8.0.134 optimizes memory usage, making it almost constant for any dataset. This addresses previous issues where some discovery projects consumed excessive memory, potentially leading to "out of memory" errors. The memory requirements stated in the system requirements remain valid.

GEODI Setup 8.0.134 introduces new predefined queries, accompanied by a new page offering more detailed explanations. These predefined queries simplify the process of addressing target data, including `Predefined:PCI` for discoveries within the PCI/DSS regulation scope, `Predefined:PII` for PII data, and `Predefined:O5Y` for legacy data older than 5 years. Further information is available under GEODI Query Rules.
