The MSI package includes Cassifier Desktop (Shell Extension) and Microsoft Office add-ins. Parameters for GEODI Classifier setup are automatically generated via the setup tab. Installation can be done manually or by using a tool like ManageEngine for distribution. Office add-ins cannot be disabled or uninstalled by users; only system administrators can perform this action.

Installed agents are monitored using a panel described in the Agent Management Panel.

Installation requires a Project (WorkSpace) for Classification Policies in GEODI, and the GEODI URL address must be accessible. For a large number of PCs, distribution can be done using tools such as ManageEngine, SCCM, or PDQ. The Classifier Agent is located at /GUI/Agents/Classifier. GEODI Server is the GEODI Server address.

MSI parameters for tools like ManageEngine can be automatically obtained from the setup tab of the classification module. The GEODI_URL parameter specifies the GEODI server address, which is recommended to be secure with DNS/SSL settings configured. The GEODI_WSNAME parameter is the name of the GEODI Workspace from which agents will retrieve classification policies. The GEODI_TOKEN parameter can be obtained from the Setup screen located in the last tab of the Classification Module Settings; it should be taken with a different user, and that user's password must be kept secure, as a password change may require re-creation and re-installation.

For distribution using tools like PDQ, ManageEngine, or SCCM, specific commands can be used. To install, the command is: "GEODI.Classifier.msi" /quiet GEODI_URL="https://icdemo.dece.com.tr/" GEODI_WSNAME="1013-TR-Kişisel Veri Keşfi" GEODI_TOKEN="EAAAAL%%2FcQ9RvjWM…". This installation line is automatically generated by the interface. To uninstall, the command is: msiexec.exe /x "GEODI.Classifier.msi" /qn /norestart, which runs with the MSI uninstall parameter.

Agents perform daily update checks and, if updates are available, they update themselves via the GEODI server without requiring any intervention.
