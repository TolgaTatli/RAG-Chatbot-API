Green Crescent protects sensitive data using GEODI Data Discovery, classification, and Symantec DLP solutions. This initiative is detailed in a case study published on April 29, 2024.

Ismail Emre Helvaci, IT Department Manager, stated that Green Crescent discovered and classified their scattered data with GEODI, then ensured it did not leave the organization using Symantec DLP. He noted the integration of these two software solutions was very beneficial and that the challenging process was successfully concluded within the framework of compliance with the Personal Data Protection Law. He also thanked all employees and stakeholders who contributed to this major project.

Green Crescent (Ye≈üilay) is a non-governmental organization focused on human dignity and integrity. It works to protect society and youth from harmful habits like tobacco, alcohol, drugs, technology, and gambling, adhering to national and moral values and using scientific methods. The organization conducts preventive and rehabilitative public health and advocacy activities. Green Crescent decided to protect its sensitive data with GEODI Data Discovery, Classification, and Symantec DLP Solutions.

Green Crescent, like many organizations, has a fragmented structure with both structured and unstructured data scattered across PCs, Shared Folders, Databases, and other sources. Challenges in correctly discovering this data include numerous repositories, various file types, and ensuring accuracy in unstructured data. An additional challenge is continuously processing and classifying data generated by approximately 1,000 white-collar employees.

Green Crescent's information security teams initiated data discovery and analysis processes with GEODI to accurately discover fragmented data and create security policies. GEODI consolidated different data sources and detected sensitive and personal data in both structured and unstructured environments through semantic discovery. During this process, data owners were required to classify data on end-user computers and shared folders, leading approximately 1,000 users to classify documents and emails with GEODI Classifier. GEODI Classification results guided Symantec Network and Endpoint Protection actions, enabling Symantec to protect user-designated private files more effectively. GEODI's flexible classification level and policy setting capabilities helped users quickly adapt to classification plugins and ensure effective use.

On average, 3,000 files and emails are classified daily by users with GEODI. Approximately 65 million contents were discovered, and nearly 1 million documents containing personal data were identified. Green Crescent's information security teams can take various security actions and continuously monitor data with scheduled scans. They can also perform semantic searches with GEODI's search capabilities for sensitive or critical data. In this continuously analyzed and classified data environment, Symantec uses its network and endpoint security capabilities to track events, report, monitor classified data movements, and take blocking and monitoring actions based on applied policies.

This project, the first joint work of Symantec and GEODI, fully met the end-to-end information security and data protection needs of an organization with a complex and large data structure. Problems like users struggling with complex actions and configurations were eliminated due to Symantec and GEODI's easy configuration and compatibility. End-users quickly developed a culture of data security and privacy. Competent partners of both vendors supported the positioning and use of the solutions from start to finish. Green Crescent now ensures compliance with GDPR and Data Security while continuously protecting its data.
