GEODI Classifier is a set of tools designed for both manual and automatic classification. This document provides detailed information about the central management application of GEODI Classifier.

The Classifier Module Configuration is accessed through a dialog that appears on the final page of the project wizard when "Enable Classification Tools" is selected. This dialog allows users to define values for classes, rules, headers, footers, and watermarks. While default settings apply universally, rules can be customized based on individual users, groups, IP addresses, or specific classification software. To utilize pre-defined class, tag, panel, and rule definitions, users must begin by selecting a template. For classification purposes, it is recommended to create a completely separate project that does not require data.

The "Classes" section is used to define class labels, their associated rules, and how they appear within add-ins, such as Microsoft Office. Classes should be organized with the most important ones listed at the top. Each class requires a unique ID and a Name, which is the text displayed in user interfaces. A Category can be assigned to create a classification tree, beneficial for managing a large number of classes, though it can be left blank by default. An Explanation field allows users to note important information about the class, which serves as guidance for add-in users and is displayed in the classification interface. A Query can be defined, and if content matches this query, the corresponding class is automatically selected.

GEODI Classifier includes predefined queries that enable immediate use for automatic classification. Documents that match a defined query will automatically be assigned the relevant class. If a standard definition needs to be altered, any changes to existing definitions will automatically update associated Panel, Report, and other rules. In automatic classification, if content does not match any defined rule, the last class in the sequence is assigned.

GEODI Classifier supports defining key and value pairs for MS Word, PDF, or ADS tags, ensuring compatibility with various classification tools for a seamless transition of existing classification schemas. Header, Footer, and Watermark values are specifically applicable to MS Office software. If a user selects a class, the chosen text for these elements will be added directly into the document. To include the name of the user performing the classification within tags, the `%User%` variable can be utilized. For multi-line text entries, `\n` can be used to insert a line break.

The "Behavior" section defines the default classification rules and policies, which are automatically propagated to all client agents within approximately 10 minutes. These rules can be customized based on user, group, IP, or classification tool via the "Customize" option. Settings within this section include "Otomatik Sınıflama" (Automatic Classification), which determines how automatic classification functions, offering options like showing it as a suggestion, deactivating it, or preventing further classification under an automatically assigned class.

The "Form Gösterimi" (Form Display) setting in GEODI Classifier controls the rules for opening the classification dialog during save, close, or print operations within MS Office add-ins. Options include "Gerektiğinde Form Göster" (Show Form When Needed), which prevents the dialog from opening if an automatic class is assigned or an existing class is present; "Her Zaman" (Always), which displays the form after every change; and "Hiç Bir Zaman Sadece Manuel" (Never Only Manual), which means the form is only triggered manually. The "OS Meta Kullan" (Use OS Meta) feature enables ADS tagging for formats other than Microsoft Office, Libre Office, and PDF, with these tags exclusively generated by the Shell/Desktop classification tool.

GEODI Classifier's "Behavior" settings also include "Eklentilerde Sınıf Küçültmeye İzin Ver" (Allow Class Reduction in Add-ins), which determines if a user can select a lower classification for an already classified document, such as changing "Very Secret" to "Secret." This is an important setting that can be overridden per user, group, or IP. "İç e-postalarda sınıflama yapılsın" (Classify internal emails) allows emails to be sent without a classification prompt if the sender and target domain addresses are identical. The "Log Formatı" (Log Format) setting controls the logging of all classified documents on the server, allowing users to deactivate this process or change the log format, with logs stored alongside other GEODI logs.

In GEODI Classifier, the "Header/Footer için imaj kullanma" (Use image for Header/Footer) setting in Excel defaults to using headers and footers as images. If this option is selected, they will instead be used as text. Similarly, the "Watermark için imaj kullanma" (Use image for Watermark) setting defaults to using watermarks as images in Excel. If this setting is selected, the watermark will be used as inactive in Excel.

The "Özelleştir" (Customize) feature in GEODI Classifier allows modification of default rules based on specific users, groups, IP addresses, or the classification application/add-in tool being used. For instance, a particular user group can be configured for automatic classification only, granted authorization for class reduction, or exempted from classification requirements. Each customization represents a rule, and multiple customizations can be added. In cases where rules overlap, the most recently applied customization takes precedence for the end-user.

Customizations in GEODI Classifier can be activated or deactivated for end-users using the "Aktif" (Active) setting. For easier management of numerous customizations, it is recommended to use systematic naming and provide descriptions. The "Kullanıcılar" (Users) field specifies the individuals or groups affected by a customization, allowing multiple selections. The "Uygulamalar" (Applications) field selects the applications impacted; if no applications are chosen, the customization applies to all. Specific features that can be customized include Automatic Classification, Form Display, OS Meta Usage, Classification in Internal Emails, and Class Reduction in Add-ins.

GEODI Classifier offers advanced customization options, including "Sınıflama Kullanılmasın" (Do Not Use Classification), which allows disabling classification for a selected group or application. "Kullanılabilecek Sınıflar" (Available Classes) enables specifying which classes are accessible to certain groups or departments within each customization. The "Makro" (Macro) feature facilitates the creation of advanced rules, such as those based on IP addresses (e.g., `IP("192.168.1.1")`) or specific time periods (e.g., `Time("09:00-17:00")`). A link, `https://service.decesoftware.com/api`, provides access to objects that can be used with macros.

GEODI Classifier allows users to customize the terminology used in the classification interface through "Pop-Up metin ayarları" (Pop-Up text settings). This includes changing the name of the "Otomatik Butonu" (Automatic Button) in the classification interface. The "Kategori" (Category) setting adds a general heading to the left of top-category classes in the pop-up interface, while "Alt Kategori" (Subcategory) adds a heading to the left of subcategory classes. If the category name from class definitions is desired for the subcategory heading, "Sınıf kategorisini kullan" (Use class category) must be checked; otherwise, these fields should remain blank if a categorized structure is not in use.

For MS Office, GEODI Classifier's Pop-Up text settings allow customization of various elements within the dialog that appears during save or print operations. The "Form Başlığı" (Form Title) can be changed, and an "Açıklama" (Description) can be added or modified for this dialog. The "Sınıf Seçilmemiş Mesajı" (Class Not Selected Message) defines the text displayed if no class is selected for the document. The "Tamam Butonu" (OK Button) text can also be changed. Additionally, "Sınıf Tanımlanmamış" (Class Undefined) refers to the class that indicates an unclassified document, visible in such documents, and its icon ("Sınıf Tanımlanmamış İkonu") can also be set.

GEODI Classifier Add-In screen allows changing color combinations on the pop-up window using "Üst Alan Zemin" (Top Area Background), "Yazı Rengi" (Text Color), and "Alt Alan Zemin Rengi" (Bottom Area Background Color) settings. If incorrect or missing values are provided, the system defaults to its standard colors. For installation, the necessary token and MSI parameters are automatically generated by the software. Users should refer to the client or OWA installation pages for detailed instructions.

Email signatures often contain personal data, which can lead to emails being consistently classified as KV (Personal Data). To address this, either email server settings need to be adjusted or a dictionary must be prepared. If the email server is configured to add the signature after classification or immediately before sending, the issue can be resolved for the initial email transmission. A solution for Exchange is available via `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/disclaimers-signatures-footers-or-headers`, but this approach is not effective for email chains.

The most comprehensive method for ignoring email signatures involves using a GEODI dictionary. This approach requires a list of senders that includes information typically found in mail signatures, such as name, phone, email, and title. A mail signature should be generated from this table using either Excel formulas or SQL. GEODI can utilize either an Excel file or a VT Table as a dictionary, though Excel dictionaries require manual updates. The dictionary must be added to the classification project. For this method to be effective, the dictionary must precisely match the mail signature, and it is recommended to test with a few senders before full implementation. This dictionary can also be applied to email discovery projects to disregard signatures in older emails. This method does not prevent the detection of actual personal data located within the email body, contracts, or payrolls.
