The North Marmara Motorway chose GEODI for a Data Discovery and Data Classification project. This project was undertaken within the scope of GDPR compliance and Data Security.

GEODI Semantic Discovery Tools are capable of scanning millions of documents from various sources, including file folders, databases, PCs, and E-Mails. GEODI automatically classifies these documents using pre-set rules based on Semantic Discovery. The results of this discovery process inform all destruction or security policies.

Data Protection Officers (DPOs) can utilize GEODI's search and insight capabilities to access and report documents containing critical and sensitive data within seconds.

GEODI offers capabilities such as Search, Discover, Mask, Encrypt, and Classify.
