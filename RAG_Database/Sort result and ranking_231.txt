GEODI attempts to prioritize the most relevant content. Users have the option to define alternative orders for content display.

Sorting keywords exhibit different behaviors on CONTENT and KEYWORDS pages. The criteria 'orderby:name', 'orderby:date', and 'orderby:layer' are specifically valid for keywords.
