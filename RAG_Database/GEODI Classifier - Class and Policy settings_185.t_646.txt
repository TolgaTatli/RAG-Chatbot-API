GEODI Classifier is a suite of tools designed for both manual and automatic classification, with this page detailing the configuration of their central management. To access the management dialog, users should activate "Classification Tools" on the final page of the Project Wizard. Within this dialog, settings for classes, rules, headers, footers, and watermarks are configured. The system offers ready project templates, which are recommended as a starting point for pre-configured settings. A best practice is to establish a separate project specifically for classification, distinct from search or discovery projects, as the classification project does not require data.

The "Classes" tab is where class labels, their associated rules, and their appearance in plugins like Microsoft Office are defined. Classes should be prioritized, with the most important ones listed at the top. Each class requires a unique ID. The "Name" field specifies the text that will be displayed in user interfaces. A "Category" can be assigned to create a classification tree, which is useful for managing numerous classes, though it can be left empty by default. The "Description" field serves as a guideline for plugin users, providing essential information about the class, and this text is visible in the users' classification interface. Documents that match a specified "Query" will automatically be assigned the corresponding class.

GEODI Query Rules are valid for use, and predefined queries are available to simplify configuration and management by allowing consistent use across classes, panels, and other areas. Tags, defined as key-value pairs, can be written into MS Word, PDF, or ADS files. If transitioning from another classification solution, GEODI can adapt the existing schema for a seamless transition. Header, Footer, and Watermark values are exclusively valid for MS Office software; if a user selects a class, the specified text will be embedded into the document. The `%User%` variable can be used to insert a user's name into these values, and `\n` allows for multiple lines of text. If document content does not match any other query, auto-classification will assign the last class.

Default Classification rules are configured under the "Behaviour" tab and are automatically updated for all clients within approximately 10 minutes. These rules can be overridden or modified based on user, group, IP, or specific classification tools by utilizing the "Customize" tab. The "Auto Classify Behaviour" setting dictates how automatic classification operates: "Use as a suggestion" allows the user to decide whether to apply auto-classification, "Disabled" turns off automatic classification entirely, and "Do not select the class under auto" prevents users from choosing classes that are lower than the automatically suggested one.

The "Ask Classes on Save" option controls when MS Office add-ins prompt users to select classes during saving, closing, or printing. If "Show when necessary" is selected, the dialog will not appear if auto-classification is possible or if the document already has a class. Choosing "Always" ensures the dialog opens after every change. The "Never - Manuel Only" setting means the user must manually open the dialog. "Use OS Meta" enables tagging of Microsoft Office, Libre Office, and PDF formats with ADS, with these tags exclusively created by the Shell/Desktop classification tool. "Allow Class Lowering" determines if a user can assign a lesser class to an already classified document; this is an important setting that can be overridden by user, group, or IP.

For internal emails, if the sending and target domain addresses are identical, the "Classifying internal emails" feature allows the email to be sent without prompting for classification. By default, all classified documents are logged on the server side, and this logging process can be deactivated or its format changed, with logs stored in the same location as other GEODI logs. The "Do not use images for Header/Footer" option, when selected, ensures headers and footers are rendered as text in Excel instead of the default image format. Similarly, selecting "Do not use images for Watermark" will disable the watermark in Excel, which is otherwise used as an image by default.

The "Customize" tab facilitates the modification of default rules based on specific users, groups, IP addresses, or applications. For instance, certain groups can be restricted to auto-classification only, while others are permitted to lower class assignments. Each rule constitutes a customization, and multiple rules can be added; in cases of overlapping rules, the first rule takes precedence. The "Active" setting allows for enabling or disabling customization for end users. For effective management of numerous customizations, systematic naming and descriptions are recommended. The "Users" field specifies the individuals and groups affected by the customization, allowing for multiple selections.

The "Macro" feature within customization enables the creation of advanced options, including IP or time-based rules, with accessible objects via a provided link. The "Applications" setting allows selection of the applications affected by the customization; if no applications are selected, the customization applies universally. Specific settings such as "Auto Classify Behaviour," "Ask Classes on Save," "OS Meta," "Classifying internal emails," and "Allow Class Lowering" can be customized or overridden. Additionally, classification can be disabled for selected users, groups, or IPs. The "Available Classes" option allows administrators to specify which classes are offered to particular groups or departments.

The "Pop-Up Texts Settings" allow for customization of terminology within the classification interface. "Auto Button Text" defines the name of the automatic button. "Category" adds a general title to the left side of upper category classes in the pop-up interface. "Subcategory" adds titles to the left side of Subcategory classes; if the category name from class definitions is to be used as the title, "Use Class Category" must be checked, otherwise these fields should be left blank if a categorical structure is not employed. The "Form Title" allows changing the title of the dialog that appears during saving or printing for MS Office. A "Description" can be added or modified for this MS Office dialog.

The "Class Not Selected Message" is the text displayed if a class is not chosen for a document during saving, closing, or printing in MS Office. The text of the "OK Button" on this dialog can also be changed. "Unknown Class Text" is the designation for unclassified documents that appear in unclassified document lists. Color combinations for the pop-up window in the GEODI Classifier Add-In screen can be adjusted using "Top Bg, Text Color, Bottom Color," which revert to default colors if incorrect or missing values are provided. The "Class Not Defined Icon" is the icon representing unclassified documents.

For installation, the software automatically generates the necessary token and MSI parameters. Further details regarding client pages and OWA installation are available separately. To ignore PII information contained in e-mail signatures, two methods are available: modifying e-mail server settings or preparing a dictionary. The e-mail server method involves configuring the server to add signatures after classification or just before sending, with a Microsoft link provided for Exchange as an example. This server-side method only addresses the issue for the initial email, as signatures accumulate in mail chains.

The GEODI dictionary method is effective for all situations involving email signatures. This method requires a senders list containing values found in signatures, such as name, phone, or e-mail. GEODI can utilize either an Excel file or a database table as a dictionary, and the signature must be generated using Excel formulas or SQL. A sample Excel file is provided, which requires manual updates. This dictionary must be added to the discoveries list for the classification project. The dictionary method's effectiveness relies on an exact match between the dictionary and mail signatures, so testing with sample senders is recommended before deployment. This dictionary can also be used in e-mail discovery to prevent old email signatures from being misidentified as PII, while actual PII data within the email body, contracts, or medical records will still be recognized.
