Data discovery using GDE on Windows servers is possible without logging in. GDE can also be installed as a service.

Classification is possible within FileOrbis. FileOrbis stores data in the filesystem, allowing direct access with an authorized user. For sources where discovery access is not possible, low-code definitions can be created for resources that offer a web API or a similar API.
