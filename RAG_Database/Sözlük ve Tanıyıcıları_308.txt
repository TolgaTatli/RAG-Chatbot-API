GEODI evaluates content using two methods: Dictionaries and Recognizers. Dictionaries are predefined word lists that contain terms such as "Ankara", "İstanbul", "yapım", and "satınalma", and can also define synonyms for these words. Recognizers automatically extract specific information from texts, including Ada/Parsel numbers, Kilometers, and E-mail addresses. For additional recognizers included with GEODI Standart and other modules, users can refer to "GEODI Uygulama Modülleri". Both Recognizers and Dictionaries are referred to as "Layers" within GEODI, and these GEODI Layers can be added to a Project to enable multi-dimensional content analysis.

GEODI Dictionaries can be shared among GEODI users. This sharing mechanism centralizes and simplifies tasks related to setup, standardization, and development.

GEODI Dictionaries can be prepared through several methods, including manual creation without the need for specific tools. When creating dictionaries manually, synonymous words should be written in a single column and separated by commas. It is also possible to import information into a dictionary from various formats like CSV and KML. The "Dosyadan" (From File) option allows users to directly utilize existing data in CSV or Shape formats as a dictionary.

The GEODI dictionary creation interface offers a "Veri tabanı" (Database) option, enabling connections to shp, csv, excel, kml, and access files, as well as MySql, Oracle, SqLite, and Postrgre databases. If this connection remains active, GEODI will periodically read updated data to keep the dictionary current. In contrast, MOBIDI can create a dictionary from a database but does not maintain a continuous connection; it reads the records once to form the dictionary. Users have the ability to map the required fields for the dictionary with the corresponding fields in the data source.

GEODI supports various file formats for dictionary creation. CSV files and Shape files can be directly used as GEODI dictionaries, with Shape attribute information being matched to GEODI dictionary requirements. Excel files (XLS, XLSX) are also usable as dictionaries. For KML files, multiple dictionary records can be generated from KMLs containing multiple geometries, using the KML's name as the word, and these generated records can be edited later. Vaziyet plans can be imported this way. KML data with a single geometry can be used by copying the geometry from Google Earth and pasting it into a new record in the GEODI Dictionary Wizard, which expects a single geometry and is useful for importing road geometry. If road geometry is fragmented, it should be consolidated into a single piece within the KML, and GEODI performs kilometer calculations proportionally, requiring the route to be sufficiently close to the real route. Netcad/Netpro Route files (KTB) are directly imported, requiring the project's EPSG code from Netcad projection settings. WKT formatted point, line, or area geometries are accepted, and geometries from sources like Google Maps can be imported via copy-paste using XY coordinates.

To share a user dictionary, it is sufficient to share the associated ".geodiDictionary" file. These dictionary files are located in the `%APPDATA%\Dece\Geodi\Dictionaries` folder. The file can be transferred to the target computer's memory, placed in a shared folder over a network, or shared via HTTP.

Sharing a file-attached dictionary requires sharing both the ".geodiDictionary" file and all the source files it utilizes. A critical requirement is that the ".geodiDictionary" file must reside in the same folder as its source files. For example, if a CSV dictionary created from "denemef.csv" has its ".geodiDictionary" file shared from "C:\CSV\", then "denemef.csv" must also be located in "C:\CSV\". This co-location rule applies to sharing via network folders as well, while HTTP sharing has distinct requirements.

To share a CSV dictionary, the ".geodiDictionary" file and the CSV file used as its source must be shared within the same folder.

When sharing a Shapefile dictionary, although the ".shp" file is specified during creation, other associated files in the same directory are also used when the dictionary is read. For instance, a dictionary created from "GOLBASIYOLORTA.shp" also uses ".cpg", ".dbf", ".prj", ".sbn", ".sbx", ".xml", and ".shx" files from the same folder. Therefore, when sharing, all these supplementary files, along with the ".shp" file, must be placed in the same folder as the ".geodiDictionary" file.

Sharing dictionaries via HTTP is largely similar to sharing over a network or by copying files, with a key difference for multi-file content sources like Shapefiles. If a dictionary's source consists of multiple files, these files must be compressed into a ZIP file for HTTP sharing. Both the created ZIP file and the ".geodiDictionary" file must be placed in the same directory on the HTTP server. For example, CSV dictionaries, which typically use only a single source file, are not shared as ZIP files, whereas Shapefile dictionaries are shared in ZIP format.

For HTTP sharing of a Shapefile dictionary, the ".geodiDictionary" file and the ZIP file containing its source files must be shared in the same directory. The ZIP file must include not only the ".shp" file used during dictionary creation but also all other files necessary for reading the dictionary, such as ".cpg", ".dbf", ".prj", ".sbn", ".sbx", ".xml", and ".shx" files. These files must be placed directly within the ZIP file, not inside any subfolders. The ZIP file's name must follow the format "[Shapefile File Name].shp.zip", for example, "GOLBASIYOLORTA.shp.zip", to ensure recognition.

To add a shared dictionary, first open the "Sözlükler" tab. Then, click the "+" (New) button located in the top right corner. In the first step of the "Sözlük Sihirbazı" (Dictionary Wizard) that appears, click the "Dosyadan" (From File) button. A dialog box will prompt you to enter the path to the shared ".geodiDictionary" file, which can be a path on the computer's memory (e.g., `%APPDATA%\Dece\Geodi\Dictionaries\GeodiDictionary_... .geodiDictionary`), a network shared folder (e.g., `\\Ortak\GeodiDictionary\GeodiDictionary_... .geodiDictionary`), or an HTTP connection location (e.g., `http://localhost/GeodiDictionary/GeodiDictionary_... .geodiDictionary`). After entering the path, click "Tamam" (OK); if the file is found and its extension is supported by GEODI, the wizard will proceed to the second step. In the second step, enter the dictionary name and optionally configure other settings before clicking "İleri >>" (Next >>), which will advance to the third step if a name is provided. Finally, optionally modify settings and click "Kapat" (Close). If the dictionary was created from a file, column name matching might be required, and a warning message will appear before closing if necessary. The screen can be closed once all required settings are complete.
