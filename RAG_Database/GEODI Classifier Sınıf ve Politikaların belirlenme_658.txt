GEODI Classifier is a suite of tools designed for both manual and automatic classification. This document provides a detailed overview of the GEODI Classifier central management application.

The "Enable Classification Tools" dialog, accessible on the final page of the project wizard, allows users to define values for classes, rules, headers, footers, and watermarks. While default settings apply universally, rules can be customized for specific individuals, groups, IP addresses, or classification software. To utilize pre-defined class, tag, panel, and rule definitions, users must begin by selecting a template. For classification purposes, it is recommended to create a completely separate project that does not require data.

The "Classes" tab is used to define class labels, their associated rules, and how they appear within add-ins, including Microsoft Office. Classes should be prioritized, with the most important ones listed at the top. Each class requires a unique ID and a display name for interfaces. A "Category" field allows for the creation of a classification tree, which is beneficial when managing a large number of classes, and can be left blank by default. The "Description" field is for noting essential information about the class, serving as guidance for add-in users, and these descriptions are visible in the user classification interface. A "Query" can be defined, where if content matches the query, that specific class is automatically selected.

GEODI Classifier includes pre-defined queries upon installation, which automatically assign relevant classes to matching documents. If a custom definition is required, altering existing definitions will automatically update associated Panel, Report, and other rules. In automatic classification, if content does not match any defined rule, the last class in the sequence is assigned.

For MS Word, PDF, or ADS tags, key and value pairs must be defined. GEODI is compatible with various classification tools, enabling a seamless transition by allowing users to define their existing classification scheme. Header, Footer, and Watermark values are exclusively applicable to MS Office software; if a user selects a class, the specified texts will be inserted into the document. To include the classifying user's name within tags, the `%User%` placeholder can be used. For multi-line texts, ` ` can be used to advance to the next line.

The "Behavior" section defines default classification rules and policies, which are automatically propagated to all client agents within approximately 10 minutes. These rules can be customized via the "Customize" option based on user, group, IP, or the specific classification tool. Automatic classification settings determine its operation: it can be shown as a suggestion ("Use as automatic suggestion"), turned off ("Passive"), or configured to prevent further classification under an automatically assigned class ("Do not select class under automatic").

"Form Display" rules govern when the classification dialog, which enforces classification during save, close, or print operations in MS Office add-ins, appears. Options include "Show Form When Needed" (dialog does not open if an automatic class is assigned or already exists), "Always" (dialog appears after every change), or "Never, Only Manual" (dialog is only triggered manually). "OS Meta Use" enables tagging of non-Microsoft Office, Libre Office, or PDF formats with ADS, with these tags exclusively generated by the Shell/Desktop classification tool.

The "Allow Class Reduction in Add-ins" setting controls whether a user can assign a lower classification to an already classified document (e.g., from "Very Secret" to "Secret"). This is a critical setting that can be overridden per user, group, or IP. The "Classification in Internal Emails" feature allows emails to be sent without a classification prompt if the sender's domain matches the target domain. The "Log Format" section manages logging of all classified documents on the server, allowing users to disable logging or change its format. Logs are stored with other GEODI logs.

For Excel, header and footer are by default used as images; selecting an option allows them to be used as text. Similarly, the watermark is an image by default in Excel, but selecting the "Use image for watermark" setting will make it passive in Excel.

Customization allows modification of default rules based on user, group, IP, or the specific application/add-in used for classification. For instance, a user group can be restricted to automatic classification, granted permission for class reduction, or exempted from classification requirements. Each customization represents a rule, and multiple can be added; if rules overlap, the most recent customization takes precedence for the end-user. Customizations can be activated or deactivated for end-users. For easier management of numerous customizations, systematic naming and descriptions are recommended. The "Users" field specifies individuals or groups affected, allowing multiple selections. The "Applications" field selects affected applications; if none are chosen, the customization applies to all applications. Specific features like Automatic Classification, Form Display, OS Meta Usage, Internal Email Classification, and Class Reduction in Add-ins can be selected for customization. Classification can be disabled for a chosen group or application. "Available Classes" allows restricting certain classes to specific groups or departments within each customization. Macros offer advanced options for creating IP-based or time-based rules, with examples provided for specifying IP addresses or time ranges. Objects usable with macros can be found at `https://service.decesoftware.com/api`.

Pop-Up text settings allow users to customize the terminology of the classification interface. This includes changing the name of the "Automatic Button" in the interface. "Category" is used to add a general heading to the left of top-category classes in the pop-up interface. "Subcategory" adds a heading to the left of sub-category classes; if the class category name is desired as the heading, "Use class category" must be checked, otherwise, these fields should be left blank if a categorized structure is not used. The "Form Title" and "Description" for the MS Office save/print dialog can be modified. Messages displayed when no class is selected, such as "No Class Selected Message," and the text for the "OK Button" on the dialog can also be changed. "Class Undefined" refers to the class indicating an unclassified document. Color combinations for the GEODI Classifier Add-In pop-up window, including "Top Area Background," "Text Color," and "Bottom Area Background Color," can be adjusted, reverting to default colors if invalid values are provided. An icon for the "Class Undefined" status can also be set.

Installation requires a token and MSI parameters, which are automatically generated by the software. Further details are available on the client or OWA installation pages.

To address the issue of email signatures causing emails to be classified as personal data (KV), two methods are suggested: modifying email server settings or preparing a dictionary. If the email server sends the signature after classification or just before sending, the problem is resolved for the initial send. A Microsoft Exchange solution is referenced at `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/disclaimers-signatures-footers-or-headers`, though this solution does not work for email chains. The most common method involves using a GEODI dictionary. This requires a list of senders, including information used in mail signatures (e.g., name, phone, email, title), from which the mail signature should be generated using Excel formulas or SQL. GEODI can utilize an Excel file or a VT Table as a dictionary, with manual updates required for Excel. The dictionary must be added to the classification project. This method requires a precise match between the dictionary and the mail signature and should be tested with a few senders before full implementation. The same dictionary can also be used in email discovery projects to ignore signatures in old emails. This method does not prevent the detection of actual personal data belonging to the sender found within the email body, contracts, or payrolls.
