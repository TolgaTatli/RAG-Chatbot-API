GEODI Standart serves as the initial module, with all other applications operating on it. Upon installation of GEODI Standart, application modules included in the user's license are automatically set up. Users have the option to install additional tools, such as 3D maps or measurement tools, from the GEODI Application Market, known as DECE-STORE.

The Konumlar Tanıyıcısı (Location Recognizer) is included in the GEODI Standart license. This recognizer interprets coordinate expressions found in documents and places them onto a map. It can read location data from photos taken with mobile phones or GPS-enabled cameras, as well as specific location expressions within documents like "+40.974968-037.89562/", "39° 42' 32° 40'", and "39° 42′ 5″ 32° 40′ 9″". Additionally, it can process WKT Geometry and MGRS information.

The Tarih Tanıyıcı (Date Recognizer) is part of the GEODI Standart license and identifies date expressions within texts and the dates of content. It supports various date formats, including "29 Ekim 1923", "Ekim 1923", "October 1923", "October 29, 1923", and "Ekim-Kasım 1923". GEODI interprets dates without a specific day, such as "Ekim 1923", as a range from the first to the last day of that month (e.g., "01 Ekim 1923 - 30 Ekim 1923").

The GEODI date recognizer can also identify dates in multiple languages, including English, Russian, French, and Spanish, which may require the installation of the GEODI Dil Paketi (Language Pack). Furthermore, it recognizes relative date expressions like "dün" (yesterday), "bugün" (today), "geçen hafta" (last week), and "geçen yıl" (last year) when found in content dates from reliable sources such as social media messages and emails. To configure the date recognizer to identify only singular dates, the "Controller.ValidateMacro" setting in the Tarih Tanıyıcı's Advanced Settings must be changed to "ValidateMacro": "Data.RecognizerBackRef.CustomValue!=null && Data.RecognizerBackRef.CustomValue.IsFixedValue", a setting that applies only to the specific project.

GEODI provides standard reports designed for various purposes. These reports are accessible to users who are members of a specific group and to system administrators. A GEODI Pro license is necessary to utilize these reports. For information regarding discovery reports, users should consult the Discovery pages.

The "Sıkıştır ve İndir" (Compress and Download) feature allows selected content to be downloaded as a ZIP file. This ZIP file contains only the file contents. Downloading a large volume of content using this feature may require a significant amount of time.

Location information extracted from content is presented in geojson format. This geojson output can be utilized in ArcGIS or any other software that supports the geojson format. Once the geojson source is added to ArcGIS, users can click on it to access the corresponding GEODI content.

GEODI Standart includes various panels. These panels are accessible to users who belong to a specific group and to system administrators.

The Görüntü Benzerliği Modülü (Image Similarity Module) is included with the standard license. This module identifies similar images from files such as JPEG or PNG, and can also find similar images from a user's computer or the internet. This functionality simplifies the process of finding desired images within large archives. To use this feature, users click the "Resim veya Doküman Ara" button next to the GEODI query box, then drag and drop a file or enter an internet image address. Users can also select a specific part of an image to search for similarities. GEODI displays the similarity ratio for the images it finds.

To enable the Image Similarity feature, users must activate the "Görüntü Benzerliğini etkinleştir" (activate Image Similarity) option in both the "İçerikler" (Contents) section and the "Kaydet" (Save) step of the Project Wizard, and then perform the scanning process. Activating this option will result in an extended indexing time and an increased index size.
