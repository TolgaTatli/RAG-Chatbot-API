MediaMon is a social media monitoring tool designed to make social media messages searchable and analyze them like any other content. It supports the promotion of Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram as content sources.

MediaMon serves as a tool for institutions and organizations to build relationships with citizens or customers. It facilitates faster action on important messages by directing social media messages to relevant units through GEODI notification capabilities, effectively making social media a 24/7 team member. The source data for this process extends beyond social media to include e-mails or forms from the organization's web page.

Incoming messages processed by MediaMon can appear on a map based on their content, without requiring GIS integration. For example, a message mentioning "112 Street, Sincan" will result in both "112 streets" and "Sincan" being marked on the map, even if the message does not contain a separate location field. These messages are then forwarded to the appropriate unit automatically or manually using the GEODI note-taking mechanism.

MediaMon is capable of conducting trend research on larger datasets, addressing questions such as popular topics or the volume of discussion around competitor products. It provides reports on topics, hashtag frequencies, and tweet frequencies across various timeframes. The tool allows for automatic extraction of topics and emotions using custom recognizers or the TextPro classification tool, while GEODI's synonymization capabilities work to reduce data discrepancies.

MediaMon incorporates recognizers designed to identify Hashtag (#x) and Mention (@x) phrases within content. These identified phrases are then used in the MediaMon Media Monitoring Panel. Additionally, Hashtags and Mentions function as linking keys for content within GEODI Discovery.

The Media Monitoring Panel within MediaMon displays the frequency and time distribution of hashtags and mentions originating from social media sources. The content presented on this panel dynamically changes based on the specific queries performed within GEODI.

To utilize Twitter as a source, a Twitter account is necessary. When a Twitter account is associated with GEODI, users can read tweets from their timeline or from Twitter searches. GEODI processes tweets from the user's account and from accounts followed by that account as content, with an option to include links, mentions, and tweets. The depth of GEODI's search for older tweets is dependent on the visibility of tweets in a standard Twitter search. GEODI does not access private messages, the linked email address, or the Twitter password, and users can disconnect GEODI from their Twitter account at any time.

GEODI is capable of analyzing search results by searching open tweets. Users can conduct detailed searches based on criteria such as word, person, place, and date. Search criteria can be categorized using positive, negative, or question options, and the "Include retweets" option allows for the inclusion or exclusion of retweeted tweets in searches.

For Facebook source identification, users can search through shared posts and comments. It is possible to read one's own and followed posts by providing a username and password, or to browse public pages without logging in by adding them to the addresses section. Users can retrieve specific posts by adding desired expressions to a query box. All posts visible to the user are scanned, and automatic scanning can be set to scan only new posts periodically. Previews of these posts are available through the index images on the page option.

Instagram page posts can serve as a content source, with two available modes: API mode and browser navigation mode. API mode requires account login, reading only posts from that account and its stream without additional settings. Browser browsing mode allows scanning public pages by adding links to the Addresses section without logging in, or by logging in to scan pages followed by the account. Unlike Facebook, Instagram does not support word queries, and search results are limited to accounts.

The scope of training for GEODI Users includes understanding what MediaMon is, how the Hashtag and Mention recognizer functions, awareness of social media content retrieval and associated access restrictions, the use of the Media Monitoring Panel, and the process of routing incoming messages with note-taking.

Training for GEODI Admins encompasses various topics, including sources such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, email, and web, all within MediaMon's objectives. It also covers Hashtag and Mention Recognizers, detailing potential problems for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Further topics include the MediaMon Panel, the possibility of using OCR, ImagePro, and FacePro with social media images, and how to convert a social media message into a task. Admins are also trained on conducting more detailed analysis with Discovery, awareness of possible problems, query specification, the effects of security updates to linked accounts, methods for handling unwanted posts, Twitter query methods, and automatic scanning, concluding with a questions and answers session.
