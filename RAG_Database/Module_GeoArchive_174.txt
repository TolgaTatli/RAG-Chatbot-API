The GeoArchive module recognizes Sheet Numbers, Coordinate Tables, Coordinate Values, and file boundaries within both Structural and Non-Structural data. This functionality enhances an archive's geographic quality and automates tasks that would otherwise require manual work with GIS software. To utilize these capabilities, users need to add the recognizers provided with the GeoArchive module to their project, with further settings details available in the project wizard help pages.

GeoArchive also supports integration with the Parcel Recognizer and/or Mileage Recognizer, which are separately licensed. This integration enables the automatic association of various project types, such as plans, expropriation maps, road projects, and intersection projects, with GIS. These projects, when created using software like AutoCAD, Microstation, or Netcad, can be linked to GIS without requiring any pre-processing steps.

The Geographic Border Recognizer automatically identifies borders from geographic information found in existing CAD, GIS, and Spatial Databases. By using these recognized borders, users can automatically view plans, plan revisions, any created project sheets, and the areas they encompass. GEODI's capabilities manage the remaining aspects, allowing the map to adapt based on search criteria. Additionally, this recognizer identifies Turkey Standard Sheet Numbers, with a default scale of 1/5000 and larger, which can be adjusted by the user.

For DWG, DXF, and DGN files, External Metadata must be defined. If not available for NCZ and DRE files, the same metadata file can be defined for them. Shape files require a PRJ (Projection) file to be available; if it is not, the same metadata file can be used in its place.

Training for GEODI Users requires prior completion of CAD&GIS User Training. Specific topics covered include an explanation of GeoArchive with a live example, the function of the Section Number Recognizer (if applicable) through a sample project, the role of the Milestone Identifier (if available) based on a sample project, a narration of the Geographic Border Recognizer's function using a drone maps scenario, and an explanation of the Geographic Table Recognizer on sample data, along with examples of Crosscutting Content.

Training for GEODI Admins covers several setup and recognition topics. These include GeoArchive setup, Section Number Recognizer Setup, creation of route dictionaries, Border Recognizer, Coordinate Table Recognizer, Layout Recognizer, and a Questions and Answers session.
