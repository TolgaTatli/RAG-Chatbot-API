The "()" operator, when placed at the end of a rule, signifies the nearest discovery results based on the given words. This operator serves as an insight tool. While search results are unaffected when the operator is used alone, it consistently impacts MAPS, KEYWORDS, and GRAPHS pages because these pages inherently require discovery results.

On the MAP page, using "Accident()" specifically means to display places that are near the word "Accident".

The phrase "Accident() Insurance" indicates a search for documents that contain both "Accident" and "Insurance", with the condition that these words must be close to each other within the document.

Using "Accident() Crash()" means that the words "accident" and "crash" should be near to each other. This application of the operator serves to narrow down the search results.

When the "()" operator is used on the keyword page, only related words remain in the results. This method can be used to find places or people that are related to accidents.

The default distance for the proximity rule is 10. However, this default distance can be overridden.

When using the "()" operator, all specified words should be within a certain distance of each other. This differs from a phrase like "Accident Crash" (without the operator), which requires each word to be side by side.

The proximity rule allows for the use of the asterisk (*) or tilde (~) operators in conjunction with it.

The proximity rule is designed to function with other features.
