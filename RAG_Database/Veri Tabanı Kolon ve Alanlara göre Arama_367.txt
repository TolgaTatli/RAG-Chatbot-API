GEODI indexes structured data such as databases and Excel files. In this data, searches can be limited by providing a field name. If the same field name appears in multiple tables, GEODI will search all of them. Queries can also be limited with other criteria.

GEODI automatically collects field names. Indexing is performed automatically, but users can specify how tables are indexed using views or other methods if desired.

Structured data can originate from different sources. For example, GEODI Desktop Explorer (GDE) is used to query PC data by IP, Computer Name, or User Name.

To search by field names, the "DB Meta Tanımları - geodi-tr - Confluence" setting must be configured before discovery.

Fields can also be generated by different sources. For example, the GDE discovery agent by default includes machine name, IP, and user information of endpoints along with content.
