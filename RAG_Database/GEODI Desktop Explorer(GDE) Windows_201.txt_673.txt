The GDE Windows Client can be installed in two distinct ways. One method allows it to run as long as a login user exists. Alternatively, it can be installed as a Windows Service, which is the recommended mode for FileServers.

General installation conditions for the GDE Windows Client require that the GEODI URL address is accessible and that a GEODI Token has been created. Clients must also have port 1982 open, which is a changeable port. For deploying the client to multiple PCs, a tool such as ManageEngine, SCCM, or PDQ is necessary.

The GDE Agent MSI can be found at `/GUI/Agents/GDE`. During installation, specific MSI parameters are utilized. The `GEODI_URL=` parameter defines the address agents will use to access GEODI, with a secure and named address (DNS, SSL) being recommended. The `GEODI_TOKEN=` parameter is also used, and instructions for creating a token are provided at `https://decesw.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/geodien/pages/3972202552/Discovery+Agent+-+GEODI-Desktop-Explorer-GDE-Installation#Token-Creation-%5BinlineExtension%5D`.

Commands for agent deployment are available for use with tools like PDQ, ManageEngine, or SCCM. For setup, the command is `"GEODI.DesktopExplorer.msi" /quiet GEODI_URL="https://<GEODI Server>/" GEODI_TOKEN="EAAAAL2FcQ9RvjWMâ€¦"`. To remove or uninstall the agent, the command `msiexec.exe /x /qn /norestart "GEODI.DesktopExplorer.msi"` is used. An update command, `start "GDE" "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\DECE Software\GEODI Desktop Explorer\Updater.exe"`, runs the updater, but this is typically not required because agents update themselves.

GDE agents perform automatic updates. They check for updates every two days and update themselves from the GEODI server, eliminating the need for user intervention.

The option to install GDE as a Windows Service is specifically used for indexing or discovering File Servers. In addition to the standard Windows MSI requirements, the Windows Service user must have at least read-only access to the FileServer directories. If remediations are desired, then write and delete rights are also required. A separate configuration file should be created under the GEODI Server for each FileServer to specify the directories to be indexed and other rules.

A GDE installation can be converted to a Windows Service using the `<Convert to Service>` script located in the GDE folder. To uninstall the service setup, the `WindowsServiceUninstall.bat` script is used. A key feature of the service mode is that it does not necessitate a login user to operate.
