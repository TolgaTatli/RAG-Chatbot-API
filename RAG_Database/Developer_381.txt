This portal was created to provide better service. GEODI and MOBIDI, in addition to their existing capabilities, can be integrated with user-owned solutions.

GEODI and MOBIDI offer many possibilities for developers. Both software consist of two basic layers: Engine and Html5 / Json / Javascript interfaces. Developers can create a completely different interface, make Engine calls from their developed software, or modify all available interfaces or specific target pages using CSS and other methods.

For engine-level development, Microsoft .NET Assembly (including c#, vb.net, f#, javascript.net, c++.Net) can be utilized. To access the API, developers can use MVC, Asp.Net, ASP, PHP, and Java. If the goal is to use GEODI or MOBIDI in custom applications, being able to call REST API is sufficient.

Detailed API documentation and examples are available on the following pages. Samples can be downloaded and reviewed from Github and used as a basis for new applications. These examples include interactive pages where API results can be viewed without writing any code.

The portal covers various topics including Basic GEODI Architecture for Developers, Sharing Permits and Prohibitions between GEODI and other applications, Integration Notes for Electronic Document Management Systems and Archive Software, and E-Commerce/Payment System Integration. It also details Customizing the GEODI User Interfaces, Writing HTML Plugins, Creating a Dashboard, considerations for preparing a dashboard, Creating a Query View, Editing document list results, Creating a Theme, Creating a Layout, Creating a Template, Map styles, and Adding a Banner to the Project.
