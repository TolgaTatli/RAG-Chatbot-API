Basic search rules in GEODI are similar to those found in other search engines like Google or Bing. GEODI conducts searches for specified criteria across all sources connected to a user's project. This comprehensive search includes all data sources, files, social media, and databases, unless the user explicitly limits the target. The term "CONTENT" is used to refer to all types of searchable items, such as a file, a tweet, or a row in a database.

Users can search for any word or words, and the search is case-insensitive, meaning that the use of upper or lower case letters does not affect the search results. To search for an exact phrase where words must appear next to each other, the phrase should be enclosed in double quotes. For example, searching for "Georgia Aquarium" will find content where "Georgia" and "Aquarium" are adjacent.

GEODI supports advanced search operators. The asterisk symbol ("*") can be used at the beginning or end of a word to represent an unknown part. The minus sign ("-") reverses any search rule, allowing users to exclude content that contains specific terms, such as "-Georgia" to find content without "Georgia". The tilde symbol ("~") is used for fuzzy searching when the exact spelling is uncertain, for instance, "Berlon~" can find "Berlin" or "Terlon".

Date searches can be performed by simply writing a specific date or a date range. Due to GEODI's semantic search abilities, it can find all relevant content regardless of how the date is written, including different formats or languages. For note searches, users can use `note:` to find all notes they are allowed to see, or `mynote:` to find their own notes. Users can take notes for all content types and can open the main content by clicking on a note.

Multiple search rules can be combined for more complex queries. Additional search rules are available in the facet area located on the left side of the interface, which allows users to add more criteria related to content types, sources, and recognizers. A specific command, `mydragdrop:`, enables searching for content that the user has added via drag and drop.
