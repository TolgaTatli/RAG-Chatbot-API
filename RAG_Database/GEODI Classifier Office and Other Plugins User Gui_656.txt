GEODI Classifier is a common name for a set of tools designed for manual or automatic data classification. It includes plug-ins for Microsoft Office, Exchange Server, Office 365, and Windows. These Classifier solutions are compatible with various DLP (Data Loss Prevention) solutions, such as ForcePoint, Symantec, and TrendMicro.

GEODI Classifier plugins are not activated until both GEODI and GEODI Classifier licenses are installed. After installation, the "classify" option becomes available via the Windows right-click menu. The specific options presented by this "classify" feature may vary based on server settings. This method creates tags for formats that support them, such as Office documents and PDF files, which are then interpreted by DLP solutions. For file types without tag support, tags are written using a feature of the NTFS file system, which is also compatible with DLP solutions.

Installation of GEODI Classifier adds a menu to the "Home" tab within Microsoft Office applications, supporting Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Compatible versions are detailed in the system requirements document. The options offered by these plugins can differ based on server settings, allowing users to manually or automatically select a document's class. The chosen class influences which labels are written, whether a watermark is present, and its appearance, all dependent on user settings.

When a document is saved or a PDF is exported using the Microsoft Office plugins, classification options are presented again. Depending on the settings, it may be mandatory to select a class before saving. Automatic classification within GEODI Classifier is based on GEODI's discovery capabilities. The rules for which class will be created can be determined in the server settings, allowing for the creation of classes like "Confidential/Private" or distinctions such as "with/without personal data."

GEODI Classifier allows for the creation of watermarks and footers based on the document's class. The classification tool attempts to place class values and watermarks in the most suitable location. The specific values written depend on definitions. Header, Footer, and WaterMark values can be configured to appear and be aligned right, left, or centered, though not necessarily all of them.

In applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, which offer extensive layout, font, and size options, it may not always be possible to type class values without affecting the document's existing content. In such situations, users are advised to try the provided options or modify their templates to accommodate the classification values. Furthermore, all situations that apply to manually created headers and footers also apply to GEODI tags. For instance, a footer might not display in some Office versions when a portrait-formatted page is printed horizontally. If document margins are used to their full extent, GEODI class labels will necessarily overlap with existing content, requiring space to be reserved for the label.

If a computer cannot access the GEODI server, only manual classification can be performed using the classification tools. Logs of classifications made during this offline period will be transferred to the server once the connection is restored. During offline periods, the classification tools will attempt to contact the servers, which may lead to slightly longer startup times. If such an issue occurs, users should contact their companyâ€™s IT department. Classification policies and rules for the class and tools are set centrally. When these rules change, the interfaces will be updated the next time a user logs in.
