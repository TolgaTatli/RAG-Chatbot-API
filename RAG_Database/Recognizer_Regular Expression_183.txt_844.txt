The canonical phrase recognizer operates based on a defined rule, allowing for the selection and separation of text parts described using a formal language. The user determines the result. This usage is generally referred to as "Regex."

The .NET Regex Tester site can be used to obtain information about regexes and to test them.

When preparing regexes, it is important to use capital letters because Geodi capitalizes words.

An example regex, `[0-9,\,]+X[0-9,\,]+X[0-9,\,]*[ ]*CM|[0-9,\,]+X[0-9,\,]+[ ]*CM`, can find size expressions in documents, such as "25X25cm" or "5x10x12.5 cm."

Another example regex, `[0-9]+[ ]*SAYFA|[0-9]+[ ]*PIECE`, can find the number of pages and pieces in documents, for instance, "10 Pages, 20 Pieces."

The regex `MIL-STD-[0-9]*[A-Z]*` is used to capture military standards, which is a worldwide term. Examples include "MIL-STD-1376" and "MIL-STD-1246C."

An example regex for recognizing Instagram addresses is `(HTTPS?://)?(WWW[.])?([IÄ°]NSTAGRAM[.]COM)(([/?#][^\s]*)|\s+)`. This regex supports different spellings, such as "https://www.instagram.com/deceyazilim/", "www.instagram.com/deceyazilim/", and "instagram.com/deceyazilim/."

The recognizer also supports the use of near keywords and validation algorithms, including Luhn, Verhoef, or custom algorithms.

The Words page can be utilized to better analyze the results.

It is important to ensure that there are no spaces at the beginning and end of the regex expression.

To use this recognizer, a Geodi Pro license and module are required.
