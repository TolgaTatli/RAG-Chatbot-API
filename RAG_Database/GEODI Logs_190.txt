GEODI maintains extensive logs of both user activities and its own internal operations. These logs offer multiple benefits, including activity monitoring, analysis using tools like SIEM, and the identification and resolution of errors. GEODI Logs are specifically utilized for tracking transactions related to security, system errors, and system changes. This document provides a detailed explanation of the logs recorded by GEODI, which can aid in interpreting information from SIEMs, and also describes a few summary reports that GEODI extracted from these logs. Information about Classifier Logs, including the GEODI Classifier Log Analysis Dashboard and Log Formats, is available.

Usage logs within GEODI record the activities of users and system administrators interacting with GEODI interfaces. Each individual transaction is represented as a distinct line in the log, containing both the time of the transaction and its specific details. These usage logs are stored in CSV format.

The CSV format for GEODI Usage Logs includes various fields: E-mail (Licensee e-mail), Date, Last traded time, Session, GEODI License Number, AppType, GS (GEODI Server), UserInfo (which user the transaction was made with), Language (User’s Language), IP (User’s Computer’s IP), TickCount (Total time of the user in the system), WS (Work Space), Action (The work done by the user), Mode, Info, Detail, Process Memory(Kb) (The memory used at the time the log was written), and Process Max Memory(Kb) (The peak memory usage has reached). The 'Mode' field is used for atomic and instant ending events, while events with a start and end are indicated on separate lines as 'Start/End'. The 'Info' and 'Detail' fields may vary depending on the action area.

Specific action values recorded in GEODI logs include 'Application(Start/End)' for starting and closing GEODI, with 'Detail' providing Server Information.

Content viewing and note management actions are also logged.

'LabelAdd (Atomic)' logs taking notes on documents, 'LabelEdit (Atomic)' logs editing a note in documents, and 'LabelRemove (Atomic)' logs deleting a note in documents. For these note-related actions, 'Info' provides the UNCPath of the document where the note was taken, edited, or deleted, with an example being 'c:\beyza_sınıflama\deneme.docx'.

GEODI also generates Error Logs, which are records of errors occurring during its operation. 'AppError' logs contain explanations of errors originating from the server within GEODI and are located in the directory. 'EngineError' logs include error explanations encountered by GEODI during scanning, such as information about inaccessible websites, incorrect PDFs, or encrypted files, and are also located in the directory. Additionally, Windows receives separate logs when GEODI and its components are running, referred to as Windows Event Logs.

The GEODI System Report is one of various reports available for each project on the GEODI Manager/Projects Page. This report offers an overview of the server settings, encompassing Application settings, Server Information, modules, and Projects. For each individual project, the report details Project Information, resources, layers, Project Permissions, and Resource permissions information.

The Doc/Layer Report is a layer-based report that provides the number of content within a project. This report includes the 'WS NAME', which represents the Project name, and 'Katmanlar', which indicates the number of content in the relevant layer within the project.
