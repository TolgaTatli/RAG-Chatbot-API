GEODI maintains extensive logs detailing both user activities and its own internal operations. These logs offer numerous benefits, including activity monitoring, analysis using tools like SIEM, and the identification and resolution of errors. GEODI Logs are specifically utilized for tracking various transactions, such as those related to security, system errors, and system changes. The information contained within these logs is designed to facilitate a better interpretation of data provided by SIEMs, and GEODI also describes a few summary reports extracted from these logs on the same page.

Information about Classifier Logs is available, including a GEODI Classifier Log Analysis Dashboard and specific Log Formats.

Error Logs are records of errors that occurred during GEODI operation. AppError logs contain explanations of errors originating from the server in GEODI. These logs are located in "the directory". EngineError logs include error explanations that GEODI encountered during scanning, such as information about inaccessible websites, incorrect PDFs, or encrypted files. These logs are also located in "the directory".

Windows receives separate logs when GEODI and its components are running, referred to as Windows Event Logs.

The GEODI System Report provides various reports accessible on the GEODI Manager/Projects Page for each project. This system report offers an overview of server settings, including Application settings, Server Information, modules, and Projects. For each project, the report details Project Information, resources, layers, Project Permissions, and Resource permissions information.

The Doc/Layer Report is a layer-based report that provides the number of content. It includes the WS NAME (Project name) and Katmanlar (the number of content in the relevant layer within the project).
