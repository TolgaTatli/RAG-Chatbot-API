Kadir Tophan, Information Technologies Director, stated that the success of their projects stems from the care shown for customer data security concerns. He noted that their work in critical areas like GDPR and PCI/DSS not only ensures compliance with legal requirements but also enables them to serve customers with secure services, aiming to achieve top customer satisfaction.

Simit Sarayı, identified as one of Turkey's largest food and beverage chains, serves approximately 1 million customers globally daily. Due to their extensive operations, they generate vast and continuously growing amounts of data. To effectively identify, classify, and manage critical information within this expanding data structure, Simit Sarayı utilizes GEODI Data Discovery, Classification, and Masking solutions to secure its sensitive data.

In the current data landscape, corporate data is generated daily from multiple sources and stored in various locations, including PCs, Shared Folders, and Databases. Challenges in accurately discovering sensitive data include numerous storage environments, diverse file types, and critical issues related to the accuracy, speed, and capacity of discovery on unstructured data. Additionally, processing and classifying data consistently generated by white-collar workers present a challenge. The responsibility for environments requiring action within the dispersed data structure rests with the relevant information security departments, necessitating their involvement.

Simit Sarayı's information security teams initiated data discovery and analysis processes with GEODI to accurately discover dispersed data and facilitate the creation of security policies through precise analysis. GEODI consolidated various data sources, using semantic discovery to detect sensitive and personal data in both structured and unstructured environments. Users were also required to classify data on their PCs and shared folders, which they began doing for documents and emails on company computers using GEODI Classifier. GEODI's flexible classification levels and policy-setting abilities helped users quickly adapt and effectively use the classification plugins. Furthermore, GEODI discovery and masking solutions were activated to enable the masked external sharing of newly created data.

Through the implementation of GEODI, users automatically classify an average of 1,000 files and emails daily. Approximately 6 million documents were discovered, with about 250,000 documents containing personal data and 70,000 documents containing restricted data detected from shared folders and PCs. Simit Sarayı's information security teams performed remediation and security actions such as deletion, quarantine, automatic classification, and masking to protect files and remove unnecessary sensitive information from their repositories. The team continuously monitors data using incremental scans and can perform semantic searches for sensitive or important data with GEODI's search capabilities. Interfaces were established for approximately 12 internal departments, including Finance, HR, Operations, and Purchasing, within GEODI's authorization and permission framework. This allowed users to mask and securely share Office and PDF documents containing discovered GDPR, PCI/DSS, and organization-specific critical data with third parties or external organizations. This process made all data in the dispersed structure controllable, with newly created data continuously classified or masked for protection as needed.

GEODI's combined Natural Language Processing-based Semantic Discovery, Classification, and Masking capabilities effectively addressed the information security and data protection needs of Simit Sarayı, an organization with complex and large data structures. The system's easy configuration and compatibility eliminated issues like users struggling with complex actions, leading to quick adoption of data security and privacy culture by end-users. Competent solution partners provided support for the correct positioning and use of the solutions throughout the process. Simit Sarayı continues to ensure compliance with GDPR, PCI/DSS, and Information Security standards while properly protecting its data.
