GEODI Classifier OWA classification requires a Manifest XML file to be downloaded and provided to the Exchange Admin/System administrator. The GEODI Classifier add-in can be installed on Outlook Web App, Exchange On-Premises, or Exchange Online. For installation, the OWA server must be able to access GEODI, and the GEODI address must have SSL defined and be valid in the interface. Additionally, the Token Username and password must be defined to remain unchanged; if they change, the installation must be repeated.

To create the Manifest file, download the XML file by selecting "Download Manifest" in the installation tab of GEODI Classifier settings. This Manifest file should then be uploaded via Add-In installation from Microsoft 365 Admin Center/Integrated Applications for all defined users or for specific users. Following this upload, the system will begin distributing the add-in to the selected users, a process that may take between 3 and 24 hours.

If the OWA add-in does not open when sending mail in an On-Premises Exchange environment, this issue requires resolution by Microsoft. Users should perform the operations specified in the provided link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/outlook-on-send-addins?tabs=classic#install-outlook-add-ins-that-use-on-send. After performing these operations, the add-in should function, and recreating the Manifest is not necessary.

If OWA mail users cannot see the add-in, several factors should be checked. Verify that the GEODI server is running. Ensure the GEODI URL address entered in the interface before Manifest creation is correct; if it is incorrect, the Manifest must be recreated and re-uploaded. Microsoft OWA servers must be able to access the GEODI server, meaning the GEODI address must be public if Exchange Online is used. Additionally, an SSL must be defined for the GEODI address, and its validity must be confirmed.

If the add-in stops working, check if the GEODI server is active. Also, verify if the project from which the Manifest was downloaded is still active on the GEODI Server; if not, it should be restored or completely recreated, which would require repeating Manifest operations. Furthermore, confirm the validity of the Token User and password; if they have changed, Manifest operations must be repeated.

Changes to classification rules do not require Manifest renewal, as all such modifications are applied automatically. Manifest renewal is only necessary if the GEODI Address or the token user changes.

It is possible to create Manifests with multiple projects and upload them to Exchange. This functionality can be utilized for testing purposes or to define classification specifically for certain users, requiring the creation of separate projects and Manifest files for each.
