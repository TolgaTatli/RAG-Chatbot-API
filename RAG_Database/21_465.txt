It is possible to integrate with an organization's own EBYS systems to enable real-time data analysis during data entry. This integration allows for an output to be filled within their own software.

Such integrations with different eBYS and Archive Software have been realized through Service APIs.

This scenario can be realized using GEODI's services.
