GEODI can discover and analyze data from many sources without requiring any agents. However, the GDE (GEODI Desktop Explorer) agent is recommended in specific scenarios: when network shares are unavailable, agentless access is not preferred, or there are many distributed endpoints. The GDE agent enables powerful on-endpoint actions such as Secure Delete, Quarantine, Classification, and Masking. This makes GDE essential for extending GEODI’s reach to remote endpoints while maintaining centralized control and compliance.

To deploy and connect GDE agents across multiple clients, several prerequisites must be met. For mass deployment, tools like ManageEngine or SCCM are required, along with a privileged user account for installation. The Project Wizard's Feed Source → GDE Connection section automatically generates all necessary MSI deployment parameters. Authentication requires a GEODI user with feed permissions, solely for generating the connection token.

Network requirements for GDE deployment dictate that client machines must be able to access the GEODI server, and the GEODI server must be able to access the clients. The default port 1982, which is customizable, must be open in both directions. For content scope, users must define which directories and file types are to be discovered on client machines, with default paths adjustable per client in the setup configurations. GDE supports Windows, Linux, MacOS, and Pardus platforms.

For Windows clients, GDE agents are automatically updated. The MSI link for updates is automatically populated during GEODI Discovery module setup, and Windows agents regularly check this location to self-update when a new version is available. On Windows file servers, the GDE agent can be installed as a Windows Service, which enables continuous background operation for server-side discovery and actions. Active agents can be monitored via the GDE Agent Monitoring Panel.

GDE configuration settings are located on the GEODI server within the `/Settings/Geodi.DesktopExplorer` folder, typically named `default.json`. Installed GDEs automatically retrieve these settings in approximately an hour, and any changes become effective within the same timeframe, even while GEODI is running. To define different rules for individual machines, additional JSON files named after the machine's IP address, computer name, or user name can be used.

The `FolderList` parameter, a string array, specifies folders to be scanned, with multiple folders separated by commas. This parameter supports Windows, MacOS, and Linux client folders interchangeably. The default directory includes user profile folders like documents, downloads, and desktops. Values are case-sensitive, and subdirectories can be defined. Using `["*"]` scans all disks. The `ExplorerPort` parameter, an integer, defaults to 1982. Setting this port value to 0 allows discovery and search but prevents GEODI from opening local files.

The `EnableLDAP` parameter, a boolean, indexes LDAP authorizations of files if set to true, with a default value of false. `IgnoreFolders` and `IgnoreFiles` parameters, both string arrays, list folders and files to ignore, respectively, and accept the `*` wildcard. These are used in combination with settings under `Geodi Settings/IgnoreFolders` and `Geodi Settings/IgnoreFileTypes`. GEODI central file/folder ignore rules always take precedence, with restrictions specified within GDE settings applied additionally. Metadata can be defined in the settings file for parsing files from clients, and these defined metadata and values are visible in the GEODI search interface, searchable using the format `:`.

By default, to safeguard network resources, only the name and date of files larger than 100MB are indexed, with this limit set to 500MB for compressed file contents. These values can be modified on the GEODI server. If indexing does not start, troubleshooting steps include checking if the client has access to the GEODI Server via a browser, verifying the GEODI server is accessible from the client's GDE by checking `http://localhost:1982/DEW?op=GetStatus` (which should return null if fine), inspecting Firewall or Antivirus for blocking mechanisms, ensuring the client machine is operational and GDE is running, verifying the status of the received TOKEN, and examining the Agent Management Panel. If issues persist, checking `FolderList` and `IgnoreFolders` values in GDE rules is advised, and ensuring the file extension is not listed in `IgnoreFiles` if a specific file type is not being received.

If GDE settings are not effective, the setting file may not be a valid JSON and should be validated. Settings generally adjust within an hour, but if the endpoint's IP address has changed, this may take up to three hours. If some files are not indexed, it could be due to default settings blocking large files, such as videos, where files larger than 100 MB or compressed files larger than 500MB are blocked; these limits can be changed, with changes effective in about an hour. If an endpoint has been formatted, GDE should be installed as usual, and the endpoint will be treated as new while old data is preserved. If port 1982 is unavailable, it can be changed to any available port, but assigning already used ports should be avoided. Setting the GDE port to 0 allows search and discovery but prevents GEODI from opening local files.

To query files from a specific endpoint, the `endpoint:` prefix can be added to the query, for example, `endpoint:myPC` to query files from 'myPC', `endpoint:myPC pdf` to list PDF files, or `endpoint:myPC pdf contract` to list PDF files containing the word 'contract'. GEODI's legacy data classification tool can classify remote files if the classification agent is installed on the same endpoint. GEODI remediation tools also cover remote files, provided the user has delete/update permission on the remote machines, allowing GEODI to delete, mask, or encrypt remote files like local ones. If the endpoint machine is closed, search remains unaffected, but files cannot be opened, viewed, or remediated.

GDE does not copy local files. However, if local file backup is needed, the "backup content" option in the GEODI source dialog can be activated or deactivated at any time. System Administrators have access to all files from endpoints. Other users' permissions depend on the `Enable LDAP` settings; if LDAP is enabled, local permissions are utilized. It is also possible to configure each user to see only their PC files, a configuration that can be facilitated by the DECE team.

The GDE API can be accessed via a browser. `http://localhost:1982/DEW?op=GetStatus` retrieves the status of the GDE Agent, while `http://localhost:1982/DEW?op=GetLastError` retrieves GDE agent errors, returning null if no error. The default port is 1982, but it may differ. Installing GDE as a Windows Service is used for indexing and discovering FileServers. This requires the Windows Service user to have read-only access to the FileServer directories and a separate configuration file to be created under the GEODI Server for each File Server. After GDE installation on Windows, it can be converted to a service using `WindowsServiceInstall.bat` in the same directory, and removed using `WindowsServiceUninstall.bat`. When running in service mode, no logged-in user is required for the service to function.

When deploying the GDE agent using tools like ManageEngine, SCCM, or PDQ, specific MSI installation parameters are required. The GDE interface automatically generates these parameters based on project and feed settings, allowing users to copy and paste the generated command line directly into their deployment tool. These parameters include the GEODI server address, connection token, desired scan directories, and optional custom port or labels. The MSI can be run with the generated line without manual editing.

The `GEODI_URL` parameter specifies the GEODI server address. It is a best practice to use a secure HTTPS address with proper DNS and SSL configuration to ensure encrypted communication and trust, especially if endpoints are outside the network. An SSL certificate should be installed on the GEODI server, and using IP addresses or unsecured HTTP links in production environments should be avoided. `GEODI_WSNAME` specifies the Workspace Name to Feed. The `GEODI_TOKEN` parameter is an automatically generated connection token linked to the GEODI user who created it. It is crucial that the password of the user who generated the token does not change, as this would invalidate the token, requiring a new one and potentially necessitating reinstallation or reconfiguration of all previously installed agents. To prevent disruptions, a dedicated service account should be used for token generation, and its password kept secure and unchanged.

For installation using tools like PDQ, ManageEngine, or SCCM, a command similar to `"GEODI.Classifier.msi" /quiet GEODI_URL="https://icdemo.dece.com.tr/" GEODI_WSNAME="PII" GEODI_TOKEN="EAAAAL%%2FcQ9RvjWM…"` can be used, with all parameters auto-generated by GEODI. To uninstall the GDE agent, the command `msiexec.exe /x "GEODI.DesktopExplorer.msi" /qn /norestart` can be used. The MSI package is not needed for uninstallation.
