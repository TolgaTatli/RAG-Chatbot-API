GEODI projects or their indexes require backup or synchronization for various reasons. Backing up the index is crucial to prevent data loss, as indexing all data is time-consuming. Recovery from a backup ensures uninterrupted service. GEODI's ability to index changing content means the difference between a backup and the current index can be quickly reconciled. Daily backups are recommended, and GEODI installation is pre-configured for this, requiring only activation. For Active-Passive disaster recovery configurations, an index copy is necessary for fast transitions, and the backup procedure remains the same. More detailed information on Active-Passive and Active-Active configurations is available on a dedicated page.

The GEODI index is located at %appdata%\dece\geodi\GeodiIndex2.0. Since the files in this directory are constantly in use, backup should be performed using a command that securely backs up GEODI while it is running to a specified index directory. It is important to note that any notes taken after the last backup and documents added via drag and drop will be lost. Backup operations can be scheduled using the Windows scheduled task engine. Additionally, the GeodiWS Project file and other settings should be synchronized, with instructions provided in the Active-Passive and Active-Active configuration documentation.

GEODI Commands, including the index backup command, are available in files with a DCC extension, which can be executed using Batch or PowerShell. An example command for backing up the index is d.BackupIndex("[Destination Directory to Backup]","[WorkSpace name]"). Users must edit the destination directory and WorkSpace name appropriately, and if multiple WorkSpaces exist, the backup must be performed separately for each. Scheduled tasks for backup can be created using the Windows Task Scheduler or other preferred methods.

GEODI offers capabilities to repair a damaged index or replace it with an existing one. Index repair can be a lengthy process and may fail depending on the extent of the damage, in which case restarting indexing is the only alternative. Therefore, recovering from a backup using the RestoreBackup option is the recommended primary choice. The GEODI Project Wizard's last page, under the "Recovery Options" tab in advanced settings, presents three distinct recovery options.

The "Default" recovery option automatically initiates a repair process when GEODI is reopened and detects corruption in the GEODI Index, indicated by a warning. The status of this repair can be monitored on the Project Management page. During this process, search and classification operations continue in other projects. Feeding operations are automatically suspended via GDE, which checks every two hours. Once the project is corrected, an "Index Correcting" warning will be displayed in the ES interface.

The "RestoreBackup" recovery option requires the user to specify the directory where backups are stored. This option utilizes backups created using the described backup method. If the specified backup directory contains no content or is inaccessible, the system will revert to the "Default" recovery option.

The "DoNothing" recovery option provides no automatic repair or recovery from backup. With this option, the index must be corrected manually. Depending on the level of damage to the index, it may still be possible to continue search and other operations, but manual correction remains necessary. The ES interface will clearly indicate that the index is corrupted.
