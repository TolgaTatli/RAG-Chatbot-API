GEODI functions as a GIS solution equipped with a robust query language for spatial relationships. This feature enables direct querying of unstructured data using words, semantic rules, and spatial relationships, resulting in significant time and resource savings compared to traditional GIS solutions. The system identifies content by utilizing geometric terms such as places, points, section numbers, parcel numbers, roads, addresses, MGRS coordinates, or photos with GPS.

The content found through queries will be displayed on the CONTENT pages, while the associated keywords will appear on the KEYWORDS page. Additionally, the map will visually present the query results.

GEODI's query rules include: bbox, Intersects, Contains, Within, Equals, Touches, Related (which is defined as a combination of Contains, CoveredBy, and Touches), Distance, Covers, Overlaps, CoveredBy, and Crosses.

The Keywords page typically lists all words present in the found content. However, this can be modified by the Keyword proximity rule or by geographic queries. When a proximity rule is applied, only nearby words are retained. For geographic queries, only words that match the geographic query are kept. To achieve this specific filtering for geographic queries, the suffix "doc" must be appended to the geographic query rules. For instance, `Distance:"Ankara geodistance:5000"` retrieves all documents containing locations within 5000 meters of Ankara, along with both geographic and non-geographic words from these documents. In contrast, `DistanceDoc:"Ankara geodistance:5000"` yields the same content but restricts the geographic words to only those within 5000 meters of Ankara.

Various usage examples and their parameters are provided for GEODI's query language. For a single point, `Related:42.5,36.4` uses lon,lat coordinates. For an area or line, `Related:42.5,36.4,43.8,38.5` uses lon,lat,lon,lat coordinates, where the first and last coordinates must be identical for an area. More complex areas or lines can be defined with multiple lon,lat pairs, such as `Related:42.5,36.4,46.0,36.4,43.2,32.1,42.5,36.4`. Other examples include `Intersects:"Line 42.5,36.4,46.0,36.4"` for line intersections, `Touches:"10 Ada 5 Parsel"` for items touching parcel 10 block 5, `Distance:"Ankara geodistance:50000"` for items within 50km of Ankara, `Within:"Ankara geocenter"` for items containing Ankara's center, and `Related:"Eskişehir Yolu geobuffer:10"` for items within 10 meters of Eskişehir Road. It is specified that coordinate expressions should not contain unnecessary spaces.
