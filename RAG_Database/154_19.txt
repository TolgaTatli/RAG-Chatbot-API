To enable GEODI agents installed on VDI machines to appear as separate machines on the agent monitor panel, specific files must be removed from the GoldenImage. This action causes the GDE/Classifier agent to generate a new ClientID for each clone.

The files required to be removed from the GoldenImage are ClientInfo.meta, located in both the %programdata%\Dece\App\GDE and %appdata%\Dece\App\GDE directories.
