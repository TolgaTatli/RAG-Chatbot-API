GEODI displays signature and timestamp information for e-signed PDF files and allows searching based on this information. It increases reliability without requiring external verification methods.

For PDF documents signed with the PAdES method, signature information is automatically recognized during indexing. When the document is opened, this information, including signers, timestamps, and certificate details, is visible.

No additional action is required for GEODI to recognize e-signed documents, as GEODI handles this process automatically.

Searches within e-signatures can be performed using query commands such as "e-imza:..." or "signature:...". For example, searching "e-imza:”ad soyad”" will find documents e-signed by the person named "ad soyad".

When an e-signed document is selected, all e-signature information can be viewed on the right side.

In the "Kelimeler" screen, it is possible to see that discovered words originate from within the e-signature.

E-signature details can be viewed in the document viewer screen by using the Info (İ) button located at the top right.
