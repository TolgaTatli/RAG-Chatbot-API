GEODI can connect to many different data sources. It can index these sources and perform discovery within a single project or across different projects.

Data sources are introduced using the GEODI Project Wizard. Many settings, such as authorization and sampling, can be customized on a per-source basis. Sampled discovery is possible for all sources.

File formats listed in the supported formats list are processed regardless of their source. For example, a PDF file located in a folder, attached to a web page, or embedded in a database record is processed in the same way.

Actions such as destruction, quarantine, or classification are supported for some data sources. Which specific sources support these actions is stated on the relevant page.

A Risk Score is requested for each data source. This scoring is used in reporting and helps in making decisions for actions like destruction or quarantine after discovery.

The Risk Score is a value between 0 and 100. It should be high for sources that pose a risk if sensitive data is found. For instance, shared areas have a high risk score.

GEODI supports various data sources including: Folder, File Server, PCs, Database (with DB Meta Definitions), E-mail, Web Page, Confluence, Amazon S3, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint, FTP&WebDAV, MOBIDI Data, BELGENET, SSH, and Microsoft Teams.

The data sources mentioned are included with GEODI Standard. For information on other sources, users should refer to the relevant module page.
