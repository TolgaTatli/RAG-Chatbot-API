GEODI maintains a large number of logs concerning user activities and its own operations. These logs offer numerous benefits, such as monitoring activities, analysis with tools like SIEM, and identifying and resolving errors. GEODI Logs are utilized for tracking operations like security, system errors, and system changes. The detailed explanation of GEODI's recorded logs helps in better interpreting information provided by SIEMs. This page also describes several summary reports generated by GEODI from these logs.

Information regarding Classification Logs, including the GEODI Classifier Log Analysis Panel and Log formats, is available.

Usage logs record the activities of users and system administrators within GEODI interfaces. Each operation is represented as a single line, containing the time of the operation, the person who performed it, and specific details related to the operation. These logs are stored in CSV format.

Usage logs include fields such as E-mail for the license owner's mail, Date for the last operation time, Session for the GEODI License Number, and AppType which indicates GS (GEODI Server). UserInfo specifies which user performed the operation, Language indicates the user's language, and IP records the user's computer's IP address. TickCount shows the user's total time in the system, and WS denotes the name of the project where the operation occurred. The Action field describes the user's activity, with details provided in a subsequent table. The Mode field is used for Atomic, instant events, while events with a beginning and end are specified as Start/End on separate lines.
