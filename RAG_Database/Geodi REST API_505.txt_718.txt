GEODI provides documentation for the REST API methods it offers. This documentation may vary depending on the GEODI version and the modules in use.

If a user owns a GEODI installation, they should use their own GEODI domain and port information instead of the domain provided in the documentation links.

The provided APIs can be accessed via specific links. The API introduction page is located at https://servis2.dece.com.tr/Api. A GUI to generate tokens is available at https://servis2.dece.com.tr/api/GeodiTokenApi.html. The complete REST API document for whole REST API services is located at https://servis2.dece.com.tr/GUI/DeceSystemInfoWebHandler?op=GetServices.

Users can find the REST API method they need by following the network tab in the browser console while using the GEODI interface.
