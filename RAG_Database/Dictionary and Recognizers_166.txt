GEODI discovers content using two methods: Dictionaries and Recognizers. Dictionaries are predetermined lists of words, which can include terms such as "Ankara," "Istanbul," "construction," and "purchasing." Synonyms for these words can also be defined within dictionaries. Recognizers automatically extract specific information from text, such as Block/Parcel numbers, Kilometers, and Email addresses.

In GEODI, both Recognizers and Dictionaries are referred to as Layers. These GEODI Layers can be incorporated within a Project to enable multidimensional analysis of content. GEODI Dictionaries can be shared with other GEODI users, which helps to centralize and simplify the processes of installation, standardization, and development.

GEODI dictionaries can be created in several ways. Users can create a dictionary themselves without any tools by writing synonyms in a single column, separated by commas. It is also possible to import information into a dictionary from various formats, including CSV and KML. Existing data in CSV or Shape format can be directly utilized as a dictionary through the "From File" option.

The GEODI dictionary creation interface includes a "Database" option, which allows for establishing connections with shp, csv, excel, kml, and access files, as well as MySql, Oracle, SqLite, and Postrgre databases. As long as this connection remains uninterrupted, GEODI will periodically read updated data to keep the dictionary current. MOBIDI can create a dictionary from a database by reading records once, but it does not maintain a continuous connection to keep the dictionary updated. Users can match the fields required for the dictionary with the fields present in the data source.

Various file formats can be used as GEODI dictionaries. CSV files are directly supported. Shape files can be used as dictionaries, with their attribute information matched to GEODI dictionary requirements. Excel files, specifically XLS and XLSX formats, can also serve as dictionaries.

Dictionaries can be created from records stored in MySql, Oracle, SqLite, and Postrgre databases. GEODI has the capability to keep these linked pattern dictionaries up to date, provided the "Database" dictionary type is selected. This feature is not available in MOBIDI, which reads records only once when adding them to a dictionary.

KML files with multiple geometries can be used to create many dictionary records simultaneously, where the name within the KML is adopted as the dictionary word. Data created this way can be edited later and is suitable for transferring site plans. KML data with a single geometry can also be used by copying the relevant geometry from a Google Earth layer tree and pasting it into a record in the GEODI Dictionary Wizard. This process is useful for transferring information like road geometry.

Other accepted formats for dictionary creation include KTB (Netcad/Netpro Route files), which are transferred directly and require the project's EPSG code from Netcad projection settings. WKT Format point, line, or area geometries are also accepted. Additionally, geometries obtained from sources like Google Maps can be imported using copy-paste via the XY option.

To share a user dictionary, it is sufficient to share its ".geodiDictionary" file, which is typically located in the `%APPDATA%\Dece\Geodi\Dictionaries` folder. This file can be saved to the target computer's memory, placed in a network sharing folder, or shared via HTTP.

When sharing a file-attached dictionary, both the ".geodiDictionary" file and the source files that the dictionary uses must be shared. It is crucial that the ".geodiDictionary" file is located in the same folder as its source files. For example, if a CSV dictionary created from "denemef.csv" has its ".geodiDictionary" file in "C:\CSV\", then "denemef.csv" must also be placed in "C:\CSV\". This co-location requirement also applies to sharing dictionaries from a network sharing folder.

To share a CSV dictionary, the ".geodiDictionary" file and the CSV file used as its source must be placed in the same directory.

For sharing a Shapefile dictionary, although a file with the ".shp" extension is specified as the source during creation, other files in the same directory are also utilized when the dictionary is read. Therefore, when sharing, the ".shp" file and all other associated files, such as ".cpg", ".dbf", ".prj", ".sbn", ".sbx", ".xml", and ".shx", must be placed in the same folder as the ".geodiDictionary" file.

Sharing dictionaries over HTTP is largely similar to sharing over a network or by copying files, with a key difference for multi-file sources like Shapefiles. If multiple files are used as the source, these files need to be compressed into a ZIP file. Both the ZIP file and the ".geodiDictionary" file are then placed in the same directory on the HTTP server. CSV dictionaries are not shared as ZIP files because they use only a single CSV file as their source, whereas Shapefile files are shared as ZIP files.

When sharing a CSV dictionary via HTTP, the ".geodiDictionary" file and the CSV file used as a source must be placed in the same directory.

To share a Shapefile dictionary via HTTP, the ".geodiDictionary" file and a ZIP file containing the compressed source files must be in the same directory. The ZIP file must include not only the ".shp" file used to create the dictionary but also other necessary files for reading the dictionary, such as ".cpg", ".dbf", ".prj", ".sbn", ".sbx", ".xml", and ".shx". These files should be placed directly under the ZIP file, not within another subfolder. The ZIP file's name should follow the format "[Shapefile File Name].shp.zip", for example, "GOLBASIYOLORTA.shp.zip" for "GOLBASIYOLORTA.shp".

To add a shared dictionary, first open the "Dictionaries" tab. Then, click the "New" button, which is shaped like a "+", located in the upper right corner. In step 1 of the "Dictionary Wizard," click the "From File" button.

In the dialog box that appears, type the path to the shared ".geodiDictionary" file. This file path can be specified as a location on computer memory (e.g., `%APPDATA%\Dece\Geodi\Dictionaries\GeodiDictionary_1ba78c30-32c0-44d3-abd2-e3200003c045.geodiDictionary`), in a share folder (e.g., `\\share\GeodiDictionary\GeodiDictionary_1ba78c30-32c0-44d3-abd2-e3200003c045.geodiDictionary`), or an HTTP connection location (e.g., `http://localhost/GeodiDictionary/GeodiDictionary_1ba78c30-32c0-44d3-abd2-e3200003c045.geodiDictionary`). After entering the path, click the "OK" button. If the specified file is found and its extension is supported by GEODI, the process will advance to step 2. Next, enter the dictionary name and configure any other optional settings, then click "Next >>". If the dictionary name has been provided, the process will proceed to step 3. Finally, optionally change settings and click the "Close" button. If the dictionary was generated from a file and requires column name matching, a warning message will appear before closing. After the necessary settings are made, the screen can be closed.
