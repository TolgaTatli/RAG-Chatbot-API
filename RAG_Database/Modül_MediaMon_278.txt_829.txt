MediaMon is a social media monitoring tool that makes social media messages searchable and analyzes them like other content. It supports the introduction of Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram as sources.

MediaMon can be utilized by institutions and organizations as a tool for establishing relationships with citizens or customers. It enables faster action on important messages by directing social media messages to relevant units through GEODI's notification capabilities, effectively providing a 24/7 social media monitoring team member. The source data for this process is not limited to social media, as emails and forms from the institution's website are also included.

Incoming messages appear on a map based on their content, eliminating the need for a separate GIS integration. For example, a message stating "I live on 112 street, Sincan. We want a nice children's park in our neighborhood" would show 112 street and Sincan on the map, regardless of whether the message explicitly contains location data. These messages are then directed to the relevant unit automatically or manually using GEODI's note-taking mechanism.

MediaMon facilitates trend research for larger datasets, addressing questions such as popular topics or the extent of competitor product discussions. It can report topics alongside hashtag and tweet frequencies for different time periods. Topics and emotions can be automatically extracted using special recognizers or the TextPro classification tool. GEODI's ability to reduce synonyms to a single term significantly minimizes data variations.

MediaMon incorporates recognizers that identify Hashtag (#x) and Mention (@x) expressions within content. These identified expressions are utilized in the MediaMon Media Monitoring Panel. Hashtags and Mentions also serve as keys that connect content for GEODI Discovery.

The Media Monitoring Panel displays the frequency and time-based distribution of hashtags and mentions from social media sources. The content shown on the panel adjusts according to the queries performed within GEODI.

To define a Twitter source, a Twitter account is required. When a Twitter account is associated with GEODI, it can read tweets from the timeline or those resulting from Twitter searches. GEODI considers tweets from the linked account and tweets from accounts followed by that account as content. Users can choose to include tweets, mentions, and links found within tweets. GEODI's scanning capability for older tweets matches the historical depth available through Twitter search results. GEODI cannot access private messages, the email address linked to the account, or the Twitter password, and the connection between the Twitter account and GEODI can be disconnected at any time. GEODI can also analyze search results by searching open tweets, allowing detailed searches based on word, person, place, and date. Search criteria can be categorized with Positive, Negative, and Question options, and the "Include Retweets" option allows for adding or removing retweeted tweets from searches.

For Facebook source definition, users can search among shared posts and comments. It is possible to read one's own posts and those followed by specifying a username and password, or to scan public pages without logging in by adding their addresses. Users can retrieve posts matching their desired query on Facebook by adding expressions to the query box. All posts visible to the user are scanned, and automatic scanning can be configured to scan only new posts at specific intervals. The "Index images on the page" option allows for obtaining previews of these posts.

Instagram pages' posts can be used as a content source, with two available modes: API and browser navigation. In API mode, logging in with an account is mandatory, and only that account's posts and feed content are read, requiring no further settings beyond account login. In browser navigation mode, public pages can be scanned by adding links to the Addresses section without logging in, or by logging in to add and scan links of pages followed by that account. Unlike Facebook, Instagram does not allow word queries; search results only return accounts.
