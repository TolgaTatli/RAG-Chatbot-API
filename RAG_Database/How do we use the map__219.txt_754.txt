GEODI operates with the motto Search-Discover-Classify-Mask. While data discovery often gains focus due to regulations like PDPL or PCI/DSS, GEODI extends beyond regulatory data discovery by offering additional features, including mapping. Maps are highly relevant as approximately 80% of daily life is connected to location and maps, providing numerous benefits. GEODI automates map creation, making it cost-free and expanding opportunities to utilize maps.

The use of maps is clear and essential for sectors such as municipalities, construction companies, architectural offices, planning units, project offices, and real estate departments, which frequently use GIS software. GEODI enhances their capabilities by integrating non-structural data, offering significant advantages. For Digital Forensics, GEODI addresses the need to identify locations within data, such as where photos were taken or addresses were mentioned. Maps are automatically generated using artificial intelligence and natural language processing, incurring no additional cost, and they facilitate further analyses like relationships and heat maps.

Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) often face resource limitations in data processing, making it difficult to employ a dedicated data analyst. A map can provide extensive insights into suppliers, customers, service points, or stores. Maintaining maps or GIS systems typically involves costs and requires qualified operators for data entry. GEODI eliminates these costs, offering a zero-cost solution that complements its mapping, search, and discovery capabilities.

An example project, AnkaPedia, is available on GEODI's website, utilizing open-source data related to Ankara. The map in this project was generated automatically from diverse sources including PDFs, Word documents, Excel sheets, DWG files, NCZ files, databases, videos, and social media. This automatic map generation provides significant insights into data without additional costs when using GEODI. The data processed could also originate from an institution's archives, invoices, contracts, projects, eBYS data, CRM, or ERP databases.

Another example project, "Map of World News," is featured on GEODI's English website. This project includes a heat map derived from approximately 100 news sites. Users can query and obtain its map based on specific topics, such as Covid or the Ukraine conflict.

GEODI supports over 200 data sources, ensuring comprehensive coverage of digital data. It processes scanned documents through OCR and includes databases, Word documents, Excel files, Open Office files, emails, UYAP files, videos, and images. This broad capability means that various documents like invoices, reports, proposal files, project documents, specifications, and contracts can all be processed by GEODI without exclusion. The system also allows for the addition of new data sources not currently listed.

The information displayed on a GEODI map can be customized based on the user's purpose. Examples of information that can be represented include parcels for municipalities, addresses of customers, construction sites, locations of companies providing services, or city/district names extracted from a report. All or some of these specific pieces of information can be shown on the map.

To find locations related to a specific keyword, such as where goods are exported, a user can type "Export" into the GEODI search box, which will display locations mentioned in documents containing that word. For locations directly associated with exports, using "Export()" refines the search. This refined query yields locations specifically linked to exports, and users can quickly switch to the Heat Map for deeper visualization and insights.

Users who possess company addresses or construction site locations can convert this information into a dictionary within minutes. Once this data is structured as a dictionary, GEODI will then map out the corresponding documents, emails, or database records.

GEODI is designed to be compatible with other GIS software, such as ArcGIS or GeoServer, and can be used alongside them. It supports international standards like WMS and includes a specific widget for ArcGIS Enterprise.
