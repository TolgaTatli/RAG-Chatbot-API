Aksiyonlar (Actions) in GEODI Discovery encompass operations such as the destruction or quarantine of sensitive content. These actions also include data remediation processes. System administrators and members of a specific group can access the actions mentioned on this page. For actions to be valid in desired projects, a specific setting must be configured.

The "Discovery-İmha" (Destruction) action is one of the data remediation scripts produced by GEODI, utilizing its reporting infrastructure. Ready-made scripts are available in Windows Batch language, designed to work with both local and remote (GDE) sources. Scripts can also be generated for other languages like Bash or Python. Destruction is an irreversible process, and users are advised to proceed with caution.

Due to browser security measures, the destruction script downloads with a `*.bat.txt` extension and must be renamed to `*.bat`. The generated script may not function on different machines due to factors such as access rights or remote file paths. Therefore, it must be executed on the machine where the GEODI Server is located.

The "Discovery-Karantina" (Quarantine) action creates a batch script that facilitates moving selected content to a specified directory. This action covers local or network directories, as well as remote directories provided by GDE. The selected files undergo a "move" operation to the quarantine area. Quarantine is an irreversible process, and users are advised to proceed with caution.

It is essential to ensure that the quarantine directory has sufficient available space. Similar to other scripts, the generated quarantine script may not work on different machines due to reasons such as access rights or remote file paths, and thus must be run on the GEODI Server machine. Within the quarantine directory, content originating from local and network directories is stored in a similar hierarchical structure, while content from remote machines is stored with an "IP.." prefix.

The "Discovery-Şifreleme" (Encryption) action generates a script that creates compressed, encrypted files in the directory where the selected content is located, without modifying the original files. This encryption functionality covers local or network directories. Users can choose different passwords for different operations and are responsible for storing these passwords. The generated script must be run on the GEODI Server machine, as it may not work on other machines due to access rights or remote file paths. Additionally, Winrar must be installed on the machine where the encryption script is executed.

Files indexed by GEODI during the discovery process continue to appear in search results and reports even if they have been deleted. The "Silinenleri Sil" (Delete Deleted) operation is used to remove these files from the index. This process applies to both local and GDE-discovered files if they have been deleted. Alternatively, the "Silinenleri Sil" operation can be performed from the Project/Maintenance menu.

The "Discovery-Toplu Maskeleme" (Bulk Masking) action requires a Masking license. This action generates a GEODI command file that enables taking a masked copy of selected content and placing it in a designated directory. Masking covers local or network directories. The generated script may not function on different machines due to factors like access rights or remote file paths, and therefore must be run on the GEODI Server machine.

The "Discovery-Toplu Maskeleme" script requires specific parameters. These include a Token, which must be obtained from the /API page by a user with sufficient authority for the masking operation. Another parameter is MaskDataMetaID, which is the ID value of the chosen masking profile, as different profiles can be defined for masking. The IDs of masking profiles can be found on the Masking page. The directory where the masked files will be saved must also be provided as a parameter.
