IGeodiContent is utilized to return and determine properties. When an implementation derives from ContentReaderBase, it enables the reading of the desired extension.

The `MyContentReader` class, which inherits from `ContentReaderBase`, has constructors that set its `DisplayName` to "MyContentReader" and its `Category` to `Geodi.CoreV1.Defines.CategoryInfoDefines.Other`. The `ContentTypeKeys` property for this reader returns "filecontent:.myfileextension". The `Create` method returns a new instance of `MyContentReader` initialized with an `IGeodiContent` source. The `GetIconName` method returns "Content/file.myfileextension".

Within the `MyContentReader` class, the `GetSectionSplitters` method yields `StringContentSplitter` instances containing "Örnek Tanım içeriği" and "Örnek Metin". It also yields a `HeaderArraySplitter` that includes `DateTime.Now`. `StringContentSplitter` implementations can process combined sub-pages from an array. Section information can be provided for each splitter, allowing details like page and bounding box to be added to the index for custom viewers. `HeaderArraySplitter` can return known types such as Date, Geometry, Name, and KM as an object array `IContentSplitter` implementation.

If a `WebContentViewerBase` implementation is used for an added reader, GEODI will open the file using the prepared interface. The `MyViewer` class, which derives from `WebContentViewerBase`, has a `ContentTypeKeys` property that returns "filecontent:.myfileextension". Its `StartView` method writes an HTML page from "GUI/ContentViewer/MyViewer.html" to the client's response and returns `true`, with all user interactions contained within this HTML content.

The `MyViewer` class includes a `WebMethod` called `MyViewerApiMethod`. This method retrieves a `GeodiWorkspace` and an `IQueryableStroageManager` to obtain `IGeodiContent`. It performs an authorization check, throwing an `UnauthorizedAccess` exception if the content's enumerator is not null, `HttpClient.AuthorizationRequired` is true, and the current login lacks the "GEODI.ENUMERATOR_DOWNLOAD" permission. Methods accessible via the viewer can be written.
