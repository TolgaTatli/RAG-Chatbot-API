The GDE Windows Client can be installed in two different ways. One method allows it to run as long as a login user exists. The other method is as a Windows Service, which is the recommended mode for FileServers.

General installation conditions for the GDE Windows Client include ensuring the GEODI URL address is accessible and that a GEODI Token has been created. Additionally, port 1982, which is changeable, must be open on clients. For deploying to multiple PCs, a tool such as ManageEngine, SCCM, or PDQ is required.

The GDE Agent MSI can be found in the /GUI/Agents/GDE directory.

MSI parameters for the GDE Windows Client include GEODI_URL and GEODI_TOKEN. The GEODI_URL parameter specifies the address agents will use to access GEODI, with a secure and named address (DNS, SSL) being recommended. The GEODI_TOKEN parameter is used for authentication, and instructions for its creation are provided via a specific URL.

Commands for agent deployment using tools like PDQ, ManageEngine, or SCCM are available. For setup, the command is "GEODI.DesktopExplorer.msi" /quiet GEODI_URL="https:// / " GEODI_TOKEN="EAAAAL2FcQ9RvjWMâ€¦". To remove the agent, the command is msiexec.exe /x /qn /norestart "GEODI.DesktopExplorer.msi". An update command, start "GDE" "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\DECE Software\GEODI Desktop Explorer\Updater.exe", runs the updater, though it is typically not needed as agents update themselves.

GDE agents are designed to check for updates every two days and automatically update themselves from the GEODI server, eliminating the need for user intervention.

Installing GDE as a Windows Service is used for indexing or discovering File Servers. In addition to the standard Windows MSI requirements, the Windows Service user must possess at least read-only access to the FileServer directories. If remediations are desired, write and delete rights are also necessary. A separate configuration file must be created under the GEODI Server for each FileServer to define directories for indexing and other rules. The GDE installation can be converted to a Windows Service using the script located in the GDE folder, and the WindowsServiceUninstall.bat script uninstalls the service setup. This service mode does not require a login user.
