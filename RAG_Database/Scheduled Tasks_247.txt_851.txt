GEODI has a very powerful scheduler that automates various tasks, and templates are provided for frequently used ones.

Scheduled Discovery is performed within the project wizardâ€™s last page by activating the scheduled Index and setting a time.

Scheduled Backup is set by default for all projects to occur every day at 03:00. Backups are saved in the Backup folder, which is located under the Project Workspace directory.

Backup settings can be modified in the "Advanced Settings" section of the Project Wizard, but it is recommended to make changes only if there is a specific requirement.

The Scheduled Report Mail template is designed to send a Summary report every week on Monday at 09:00 clock, and the report or period can be changed.

The template for Scheduled Report Mail, SendWeeklyReport.jSettings.sample, is located in the Settings\Notifications\TimedNotification folder.

To configure Scheduled Report Mail, the SendWeeklyReport.jSettings.sample file must be renamed to SendWeeklyReport.jSettings.

For Scheduled Report Mail, the [TOMAIL] value needs to be replaced with recipients, and a semicolon (;) can be used between e-mail addresses.

For Scheduled Report Mail, the [WSNAME] value needs to be replaced to workspace you.

Multiple settings for different periods, projects, or reports can be configured by copying the jsettings file and setting a new ID.
