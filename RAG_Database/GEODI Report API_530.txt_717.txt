GEODI Reports can be accessed through the search interface by clicking on the three dots. This document explains how to access these reports and additional functionalities using the API. GEODI Report services can also be utilized as user-defined web services, provided appropriate definitions are in place.

The Report REST API allows for the retrieval of reports defined within GEODI. The format of the returned result varies based on the report type. For instance, a GeoJSON report yields JSON output, while other report types may return data in HTML, CSV, or Excel formats. Up-to-date methods for this API are available at `https://servis2.dece.com.tr/geodiexporthandler?op=.wsdl&loginWithGuest=1`.

To request a report via the Report REST API, the URL format is `[GEODIURL]/GeodiExportHandler?op=ExportQueryResult&ReportID=[raporun IDsi]&st_wsName=[WSNAME]&st_query=[StrorageManagerQueryOptions_JSON]&languagetemp=[en-US|tr-tr|..]&UserSession=[TOKEN]`. Key parameters include `wsName` (a string representing the workspace name), `query` (a JSON object where a specific property is sufficient for most searches, with query syntax detailed in "GEODI Query Rules"), `ReportID` (the ID of the report), and `languagetemp` (specifying the ISO code for the report language, such as `en-US` or `tr-tr`). The HttpMethod for these requests can be GET or POST.

When interacting with the Report REST API, several error codes may be encountered. These include 401 for Unauthorized access or Access denied, 403 for Forbidden access, 511 for Network Authentication Required, 501 for Server Error or Untrusted Request, 204 for No Content, and 408 for an Unknown Workspace.

An example of a Report REST API request is `https://service.decesoftware.com/GeodiExportHandler?op=ExportQueryResult&ReportID=GeoJSON&st_wsName=Sample Project&st_query={FillOptions:128}&languagetemp=en-US&UserSession=[Token]`. Users must replace the `https://service.decesoftware.com` address with their specific GEODI address when making requests.

The Custom Service Report API differs from the standard Report REST API in that its results can resemble GEODI views. The behavior of this API is modified by the `queryMode` parameter. Similar to the Report REST API, the return value depends on the report type; GeoJSON reports return JSON, while others may return HTML, CSV, or XLSX. Up-to-date methods for this API are available at `https://servis2.dece.com.tr/geodiexporthandler?op=.wsdl&loginWithGuest=1`.

Requests to the Custom Service Report API use the URL format `[GEODIURL]/GeodiExportHandler?op=Export2&queryMode=[DLV|KLV|..]&ReportID=[raporun IDsi]&wsName=[WSNAME]&query=[StrorageManagerQueryOptions_JSON]&languagetemp=[en-US|tr-tr|..]&UserSession=[TOKEN]`. Parameters such as `wsName`, `query`, `ReportID`, `languagetemp`, and `UserSession` function identically to those in the standard Report REST API. The HttpMethod for these requests can be GET or POST.

The `queryMode` parameter in the Custom Service Report API accepts several values that define its behavior. `DLV` behaves like DLV and results in a `d` object with `QueryGeodiContentReference`. `KLV` works with KLV query results, also yielding a `d` object with `QueryGeodiContentReference`. `SUMMARY` works with Summary query results, producing a `d` object with `SummaryServiceResult`. Additionally, `QUERY_DOCUMENTS` is a simple DLV query without REST API attachments, `QUERY_KEYWORDS` is a simple KLV query without REST API attachments, and `QUERY_SUMMARY` is a simple Summary query without REST API attachments; all three of these also result in a `d` object with `QueryGeodiContentReference`. If `querymode` is empty, `GeodiEntry` is used.

Expected errors for the Custom Service Report API are consistent with those of the standard Report REST API. These include 401 for Unauthorized access or Access denied, 403 for Forbidden access, 511 for Network Authentication Required, 501 for Server Error or Untrusted Request, 204 for No Content, and 408 for an Unknown Workspace.

A sample request for the Custom Service Report API is `https://service.decesoftware.com/GeodiExportHandler?op=Export2&queryMode=DLV&ReportID=DocumentReport&wsName=Sample Project&query={startIndex:2,endIndex:4}&languagetemp=tr-tr&UserSession=[TOKEN]`. Users are instructed to replace the `service.decesoftware.com` address with their own GEODI address.
