Before installation, users are informed about a few steps. Firstly, it is necessary to ensure that a server meets the minimum requirements for a GEODI Server. If the license covers PC discovery and Classifier, users must also check if endpoints meet the requirements.

Users are also asked to answer questions about their preferences on the GEODI Installation Checklist. This checklist is available as a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet file named 'Geodi_Installation_CheckList.xlsx'. The file was modified on Oct 04, 2022, by serdar ak.

The installation will continue on GEODI Server Installation and Configuration. Teams will provide support during these processes.
