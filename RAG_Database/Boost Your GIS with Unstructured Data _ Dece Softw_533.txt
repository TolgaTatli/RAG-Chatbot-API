The claim that "80% of data is about location" is stated as surprisingly accurate, though its origin is unknown. While the definition of Data and Location can be narrow for GIS software, in real life, they can manifest in diverse ways. A location can be a place name, country name, street name, construction site, land parcel ID, company headquarters, lat-lon value, MGRS value, road segment, or a photograph. Data occurs in diverse forms, including CRM records, E-mails, invoices, reports, complaints, proposals, lawsuits, or social media messages. These examples are referred to as unstructured data, and it is estimated that over 90% of produced data is unstructured. GIS systems typically require this mainly unstructured data to be converted into a structured form, either manually or using a custom tool.

The GEODI Platform offers an alternative and sustainable solution to handle unstructured data for GIS. This solution eliminates the need for data conversion, manual data entry, or associated hassle. It is simple to install and operates automatically, leveraging AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). GEODI possesses an adaptor and intelligence designed to understand location information, regardless of the diversity of the content. The GEODI solution can function independently or integrate with existing GIS solutions such as ArcGIS or Open Source systems.

Various organizations and sectors can significantly benefit from using GEODI. These include Construction or Energy companies, Project offices, Banks, Land Management Authorities, Municipalities, Road authorities, Large facilities, and the Military.

DECE Software's solutions have been recognized and listed in Gartner's "Hype Cycle for Analytics and Business Intelligence, 2020" and "Hype Cycle for Customer Experience Analytics, 2020" reports.
