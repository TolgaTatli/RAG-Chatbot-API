Search rules apply to the name and body of content. However, if you want to search only by the name of the content, such as a file name, you can use the or prefix.

Content names can be seen in GEODI search results.

You can search only by content type. Content types can be learned from the facet area.

Specific search examples include finding only PDF files, finding all content that starts with 'EÄŸitim' (which can be a file or a tweet), and finding tweets.

Further specific search examples for tweets include finding tweets that contain 'kelimesi' in their body, and finding tweets that contain 'futbol' in their title.

The term 'notlar' can be used to find notes, and this is described as a short way to search for notes.
