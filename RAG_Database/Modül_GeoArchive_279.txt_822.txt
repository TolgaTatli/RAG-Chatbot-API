The GeoArchive module recognizes Sheet Numbers, Coordinate Tables, Coordinate Values, and file boundaries within structured and unstructured data. This capability allows archives to gain geographic attributes, automating tasks that would otherwise require manual effort with GIS software. To enable this, the recognizers included with the GeoArchive module need to be added to the project. Settings for recognizers can be found in the project wizard help pages.

GeoArchive can also operate with separately licensed Parcel Recognizer and/or Kilometer Recognizer. This functionality enables plans, expropriation maps, road projects, and intersection projects created with AutoCAD, Microstation, or Netcad to be automatically linked with GIS without requiring any pre-processing.

The Geographic Boundary Recognizer automatically identifies boundaries from geographic information present in existing CAD, GIS, and Spatial Databases. These boundaries allow for the automatic viewing of plans, plan revisions, all types of project sheets, and their covered areas. The recognizer also recognizes Turkish Standard Sheet Numbers, with a default scale of 1/5000 and larger, which can be changed.

For DWG, DXF, and DGN files, external metadata must be defined. For NCZ and DRE files, the same metadata file can be defined if not already present. Shape files require a PRJ (Projection) file, but if it is not found, the same metadata file can be used.

Training is available for GEODI Users and GEODI System Administrators. GEODI Users must have completed CAD&GIS User Training and can learn about GeoArchive, Parcel Recognizer, Kilometer Recognizer, Geographic Boundary Recognizer, Geographic Table Recognizer, and examples of intersecting content. GEODI System Administrators can receive training on GeoArchive installation, Parcel Recognizer installation (including geometry sources like megsis and databases), Kilometer Recognizer installation (including route dictionary creation), Boundary Recognizer, Coordinate Table Recognizer, Sheet Recognizer, and a Q&A session.
