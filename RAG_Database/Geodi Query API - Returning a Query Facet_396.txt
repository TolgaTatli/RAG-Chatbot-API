Generating a Geodi Token is needed for operations like GetFacet. The GetFacet operation returns summary information of documents matching a query result.

The GetFacet operation can be requested via the URL [GEODIURL]/QueryHandler?op=GetFacet&q=[SearchString]&options=[OptionsJSON]&UserSession=[TOKEN]. This request requires the `wsName` parameter, which is a string representing the name of the workspace to search inside, and the `q` parameter, a string for the query text. An optional `options` parameter can be used for additional parameters to change the query results.

Optional parameters for the GetFacet operation include `ContentIDFilter`, an integer array that filters the content from which to query. The `Envelope` parameter, defined as [LonMin(int),LatMin(int),LonMax(int),LatMax(int)], returns words within the boundaries of a given BBOX geometry. `LayerIdFilter`, an integer array, filters words according to the IDs of the recognizers that recognize these words. `KeywordIdFilter`, also an integer array, filters words by IDs.

The GetFacet operation supports both GET and POST HTTP methods. Expected errors for this operation include 401 Unauthorized access / Access denied, 403 Forbidden, 511 Network Authentication Required, and 501 Server Error.

The resulting value from a GetFacet operation is a JSON object containing various summary fields. `LastWSScanKey` provides the key to the latest scan. `TotalDocument` indicates the total number of documents in the workspace, while `TotalDeletedDocument` shows the total number of deleted documents. `TotalGeodiKeyword` represents the number of words found with the search, and `TotalHasNote` is the number of contents that have notes. `FoundDocument` specifies the number of found documents matching the query, `FoundGeodiKeyword` is the number of found words matching the keyword, and `FoundHasGeo` is the number of found contents that have geometry. `DocForEnumerator` provides enumerator ID and number pairs indicating which enumerator provides content matching query results. `DocForRecognizer` gives identifier ID and number pairs for which identifier recognizes the number of contents matching the query result. `DocForContentType` expresses content-type key-value and number pairs for how many content of which type.

An example request for the GetFacet operation is [GEODIURL]/QueryHandler?op=GetFacet&wsName=PROJE&wsName=PROJE&q=ankara. For this request, an example resulting value shows a `LastWSScanKey` of "20.01.2017 00:00:00", `TotalDocument` as 5, `TotalDeletedDocument` as 0, and `TotalGeodiKeyword` as 400. Other example results include `TotalHasNote` as 0, `FoundDocument` as 4, `FoundGeodiKeyword` as 0, `FoundDocLabel` as 0, and `FoundHasGeo` as 0. The `DocForEnumarator` is {"-1234":4}, `DocForRecongizer` is {"-2435":4,"-3456":4}, and `DocForContentType` is {"filecontent:.doc":2,"filecontent:.xls":1,"filecontent:.pdf":1}.

Example applications for interacting with the GetFacet operation include .Net WinForm (C#), Java, and HTML - Javascript.
