Before installation, users are informed about several steps. It is necessary to ensure that a server meets the minimum requirements for a GEODI Server. If the license covers PC discovery and Classifier, users must also check if endpoints meet the requirements.

Users are also asked to answer questions about their preferences on the GEODI Installation Checklist. The installation process will then continue with the GEODI Server Installation and Configuration.

Teams will provide support during these processes. The text concludes by thanking the user for trusting and choosing GEODI.

The 'Pre Installation Checklist' is a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet file named 'Geodi_Installation_CheckList.xlsx'. This file was modified on October 04, 2022, by serdar ak.
