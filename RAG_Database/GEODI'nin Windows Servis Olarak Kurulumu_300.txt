GEODI can be made into a Service after installation. To make it a Service, the GEODI.WindowsServiceInstall.bat file, located in the GEODI directory, must be run with administrator privileges. The GEODI Service starts without needing a login session, which makes it necessary to install GEODI as a service for continuous operation.

Windows will request an administrator username and password during the service installation; this information is not requested by GEODI. The user associated with these credentials must have access rights to the directories GEODI will index and other Windows resources.

Upon successful installation, the GEODI Service will be listed as "GEODI.WindowsService" in the service list. The service can be stopped or started at any time, but GEODI.exe should not be open when starting the service. To uninstall the service, the GEODI.WindowsServiceUnInstall.bat file, located in the same directory, can be used.

If a mapped directory is used in GEODI resources or for other tasks that need to be performed at startup, the necessary *.bat file should be placed in the GEODI â†’ Settings/BatchFiles/Startup directory.
