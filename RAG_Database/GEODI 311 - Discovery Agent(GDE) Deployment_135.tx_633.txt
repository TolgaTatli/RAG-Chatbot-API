This course covers the deployment of GEODI Discovery agent to endpoints, which may include Windows, Linux, or MacOS. Knowledge of ManageEngine, SCCM, or a similar tool is relevant. The content of the course is technical, with a duration of 45 minutes plus an additional 45 minutes. There are no prerequisite trainings listed.

GEODI Desktop Explorer (GDE) is used to discover and index files on a remote machine when a share is not possible or not preferred. GDE Agent Deployment requires a token, a GEODI server to feed, and preferences, all of which are explained in the provided link: https://decesw.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/geodien/pages/3972202552/GEODI+Desktop+Explorer+GDE+Installation. Creating a token user is considered a best practice.

For a large number of endpoints, it is necessary to use a tool such as ManageEngine, SCCI, or similar, with all relevant information available at https://decesw.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/geodien/pages/3972202552/GEODI+Desktop+Explorer+GDE+Installation. The installation procedures are different for each operating system. GDE can also be used to discover file servers; in this case, the installation can be run, and values manually entered for each server. For Windows OS, GDE should be configured as a Windows Service.

It is possible to use different preferences for each endpoint or server, with settings stored centrally for each endpoint. A single setting can be used for all, or settings can be customized by IP or ComputerName. Any change becomes effective in approximately 2-3 hours. GDE wakes every 2 hours and feeds the local files to the server. If the server cannot process all the files, they wait in a queue, and no intervention is needed. Changed files will be versioned, and any file deleted on the endpoint resides in the GEODI Index. To purge such content, a command should be run periodically in the Index maintenance.

GEODI has preset rules to prevent GDE feeds from bogging the network and server. By default, videos and files bigger than 100BM are filtered out, and compressed files have a 500MB limitation. These limitations can be changed. It is possible to Batch Classify files discovered with GDE if a Classification Agent is also installed on the same endpoint. Agents update themselves for Windows endpoints when a new version is ready, with DECE Servers as the default update address. For a large number of endpoints, it is strongly recommended to change and set an offline update environment for the organization, with offline installation details covered in the relevant pages.

Troubleshooting topics include token validation, endpoint/server visibility, and port 1982, with further details available at https://decesw.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/geodien/pages/3972202552/GEODI+Desktop+Explorer+GDE+Installation#Troubleshooting.
