The GEODI OCR module can operate on scanned documents, images, and even videos. It makes text, barcodes, and QR codes within these data sources searchable.

To use the OCR module, a GEODI OCR Module license is required. GEODI OCR offers two different methods: one uses the GEODI OCR infrastructure, and the other uses the ABBYY engine. The ABBYY option may require additional licenses and per-use fees. The GEODI OCR engine is stated to be better in performance and does not require usage fees beyond the license.

Scanned documents can be converted into SPDF (Searchable PDF) format. Creating an SPDF requires additional space and time. When the result is a PDF, the searched word is highlighted on the PDF. OCR processing for very large documents, such as scanned projects, is optional. Barcode and QR code recognition can be enabled. Producing an SPDF can increase the total processing time by approximately 50%.

General OCR settings should be configured on the last page of the project wizard, and these settings affect all sources. Users can determine which engine (GEODI or ABBYY) will be used for OCR. Additional languages can be added based on the languages present in the documents. Fast OCR can provide a 50% to 70% time saving, with only a slight decrease in performance but a significant time gain.

Delayed OCR is a command that allows OCR settings to be activated later in a scanned project. It initiates a Rescan service for OCR. Since projects with OCR enabled have longer scanning times, this command saves time by allowing the project to be scanned without OCR initially, then activating OCR settings to process un-OCR'd content in the background. This command does not perform repeated OCR and focuses on avoiding unnecessary file version increases. It can be run from the interface or via DCC. In the interface, users can restrict the content to be OCR'd by writing a query criterion in the "OCR un-OCR'd" field. The "OCR un-OCR'd" command will not run if OCR settings are not active in the project, and it does not allow a new OCR repair process to start before a current one finishes. When the command is run, a message screen appears asking for confirmation to proceed with content examination for OCR in the background. To run the command with DCC, a specific command needs to be written, though "query" is not mandatory.

OCR is a time-consuming process that can occupy computers and servers. This should be considered if there are many documents requiring OCR. The fastest option is to have Fast OCR active and not create SPDFs.

The success of the OCR process depends on the scanning resolution and quality of the documents. Performance decreases with blueprints or very old documents, images taken at an angle with a mobile phone, or curved images like those from partially opened books.

For the GEODI OCR module to function, the C++ Runtime 2015-2019 package must be installed in the operating environment.

Detailed technical OCR settings are available in the OCR module. These settings can be adjusted within the OCRSettings.json file located in the GEODI/Settings/Geodi.OCR directory. If no settings have been made, this file will have a .sample extension, which must be deleted and saved with a .json extension. JSON rules must be followed when writing content. GEODI needs to be restarted for these changes to take effect.

Specific technical settings include "NoSpellCheck" (true/false) which allows correction of misspelled words using GEODI's internal dictionaries, "NoConnectedWordCheck" (true/false) which preserves the meaning of words hyphenated at the end of a line, and "NoEnhance" (true/false) which corrects distortions in documents to be OCR'd, performs OCR, and places the found characters on the original page. The "Quality" value relates to the quality of images in the document and does not change OCR quality; increasing this value increases OCR time and SPDF size. "MaxPageCount" has a default value of 64, limiting the number of pages to be OCR'd; only the first 64 pages are processed, with other pages added as is, and increasing this value increases processing time.

The training scope for GEODI Users covers what OCR is, the impact of OCR performance on search, expectations, and reviewing examples of documents to be OCR'd, including good documents, dirty documents, mobile phone images, book pages, and barcode/QR code examples. It also includes photos, videos, and explanations of how the process occurs automatically via drag-and-drop or other data addition methods, barcode recognition, and awareness of OCR process performance.

The training scope for GEODI Administrators includes the differences between GEODI-OCR and ABBYY and reasons to choose GEODI OCR (better performance, no per-transaction fees, and the document covers GEODI OCR). It also addresses that OCR requires processing power, and OCRing everything will be a long process.

Administrator training also covers OCR installation, activating OCR and barcode recognition for a source within a GEODI Project, and general OCR settings in a GEODI Project. This includes FastOCR settings (what it is, how it's done, its effect on speed), SPDF settings (what it is, how it's done, its benefits, what happens if not used, and its effect on capability), and why TIFF files are deleted or kept (for savings, as they are not needed after OCR and take up space).

Further topics for administrator training include user interaction (always asking the user), video OCR, mask application (reasons, removal of camera traces, removal of edges), details that can be captured with video OCR, and considerations if all images are to be OCR'd. It also covers that GeoTIFF and TIFF files containing geometric information do not form SPDFs, awareness of the SPDF directory and metafile, and multi-language OCR.
