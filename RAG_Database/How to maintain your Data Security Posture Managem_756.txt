According to Gartner, Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) provides visibility into where sensitive data is located, who has access to it, how it has been used, and the security posture of the data stored or application.

GEODI is an all-in-one platform designed to address Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) needs. It offers comprehensive data discovery and classification, real-time monitoring, automated remediation, and regulatory compliance, enabling organizations to maintain a robust security posture. GEODI provides visibility and control over data, protecting sensitive information, mitigating risks, and consistently achieving compliance within a single, integrated platform.

DSPM is critical because organizations store valuable data in increasingly complex environments. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 80% of enterprises will have adopted multiple public cloud IaaS offerings. The flexibility and scale of these cloud environments also make securing data more difficult, increasing the risk of data breaches.

Data Discovery and Classification is a key component of DSPM. DSPM solutions continuously discover and classify data across all environments, including on-premises, cloud, hybrid, or multi-cloud setups, identifying sensitive, personal, and other critical information. Data is categorized based on its sensitivity, type, and regulatory requirements to help organizations prioritize security measures.

Risk Assessment is another key component of DSPM. DSPM tools assess risk levels associated with data assets by identifying vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or compliance gaps. These tools also model potential threats based on discovered data and existing security controls to anticipate and mitigate risks.

Security Controls and Enforcement are integral to DSPM. DSPM solutions enforce security policies across data environments, ensuring data protection aligns with organizational and regulatory requirements. They also manage access to specific data, monitor access patterns, and prevent unauthorized access or exfiltration.

Continuous Monitoring is a key component of DSPM. DSPM continuously monitors data security posture, providing real-time insights into data security events, anomalies, and potential breaches. The system generates automated alerts for security incidents, policy violations, or any changes in data posture that could indicate a security risk.

Remediation and Response are crucial aspects of DSPM. DSPM tools often include automated remediation capabilities for immediate fixes to identified security issues, such as patching vulnerabilities, adjusting permissions, or encrypting data. DSPM also provides a framework for responding to data breaches or security incidents, including steps to contain, investigate, and recover.

Compliance Management is a key component of DSPM. DSPM ensures that data security practices align with relevant regulations like GDPR, CCPA, PDPL, and HIPAA. The system generates compliance reports and maintains audit trails, simplifying the process of demonstrating compliance to regulatory bodies.

Security Posture Assessment is a key component of DSPM. DSPM solutions often include scoring mechanisms to assess the overall security posture of the data environment, helping organizations understand their standing and areas for improvement. They also allow for benchmarking the organization's security posture against industry standards or peer organizations to identify gaps and best practices.

GEODI is a valuable tool for maintaining Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) through its comprehensive data discovery and classification capabilities. It automatically scans and discovers data across all environments, including on-premises, cloud, hybrid, and multi-cloud setups, providing visibility into data storage and processing. GEODI classifies data based on predefined or custom policies, categorizing it by sensitivity and regulatory requirements, which is essential for prioritizing security measures and managing risk.

GEODI supports Risk Assessment for DSPM by identifying potential vulnerabilities associated with sensitive data through discovery and classification. Understanding where sensitive data resides enables firms to assess risks related to data breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance gaps. GEODI also provides contextual analysis, including who has access to data and how it is used, to help assess the potential impact of security threats and inform data protection decisions.

GEODI aids in Security Controls and Enforcement for DSPM by enforcing data security policies based on data classification and sensitivity. This ensures data is handled and protected according to organizational and regulatory requirements. GEODI also helps manage access to sensitive data, ensuring only authorized personnel can view or manipulate it, which is critical for maintaining a strong security posture.

GEODI facilitates Continuous Monitoring for DSPM by continuously monitoring data environments and offering real-time insights into data security events, access patterns, and potential anomalies. This continuous monitoring allows firms to detect and respond to security issues promptly. The platform generates automated alerts for security incidents, policy violations, or changes in data posture that could indicate a security risk, enabling swift action.

GEODI supports Remediation and Response for DSPM through automated remediation actions like Masking, encrypting, deleting, or relocating sensitive data, ensuring identified risks are addressed quickly. In the event of a data breach or security incident, GEODI provides tools to investigate, contain, and recover, helping to minimize damage and restore security.

GEODI assists with Compliance Management for DSPM by helping firms align their data management practices with regulations such as GDPR, PDPL, and CCPA. By ensuring data is discovered, classified, and protected appropriately, GEODI supports ongoing compliance efforts. The platform maintains audit logs and generates compliance reports, which are essential for demonstrating adherence to data protection regulations and preparing for audits.

GEODI contributes to Security Posture Assessment for DSPM by assessing the overall security posture of an organization's data environment through analysis of discovered data, classification accuracy, and policy enforcement. This assessment helps organizations understand their security standing and identify areas for improvement. GEODI also enables benchmarking by comparing an organization's data security practices against industry standards or regulatory benchmarks to identify gaps and best practices.

GEODI's robust data discovery, classification, monitoring, and remediation capabilities make it an effective tool for firms aiming to maintain a strong Data Security Posture Management (DSPM). By providing visibility, control, and automation, GEODI helps organizations protect their data, reduce risks, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations, which are critical for maintaining an optimal security posture. GEODI offers a cycle of compliance with Search, Discovery, Masking, and Classification.
