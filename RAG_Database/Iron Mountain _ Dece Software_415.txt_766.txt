Iron Mountain uses GEODI 360 to generate city furniture and scape inventory with videos. This inventory automatically connects with GIS. Videos, taken by low-cost cameras on cars or other vehicles, are processed via artificial intelligence to capture city inventory. This process allows for marking problematic areas and assigning necessary tasks to field teams from an office. The system can also show the history of an area, including how it looked in the past, enabling it to determine the exact time problems occurred and when they were solved.
