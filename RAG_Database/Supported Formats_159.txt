GEODI supports over 200 formats, though support may vary depending on the license. It reads text information, contact information, and other metadata within each format, making the information searchable. Users can select specific formats in the GEODI search interface, for example, to search only PDFs.

GEODI supports Microsoft Office formats including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Visio. Specific file types supported are DOC, DOCX, RTF, XLS, XLSM, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, and XPS. It supports MS Word and Excel versions 97-2003 and later. Features available for these formats include Labelling and Masking, which can be Permanent or Dynamic.

GEODI supports Libre Office and Open Office formats, specifically ODT and ODP, with features like Labelling and Masking. For PDF files, GEODI can automatically OCR them if they do not contain text information, and it also reads e-Signature information from e-Signed PDFs. PDF features include Labelling, Masking (Permanent or Dynamic), E-Signature, and OCR.

GEODI supports email from various servers such as Google Mail, Yahoo Mail, Office 365, Exchange, and others via POP3 and IMAP for servers like Zimbra. It also supports email files like PST and OST. The system crawls the email body and all attachments. Features include Classification for Office 365, and for enterprise search, each user can access their own emails.

GEODI supports a range of picture, video, and audio file formats. Picture formats include JPG, JPEG, PNG, TIF, TIFF, GIF, BMP, and JP2. Video and audio formats supported are M2TS, MOV, MP4, MP3, OGG, AVI, 3GP, ASF, FLV, MKV, MPG, MPEG, OGV, WMV, DIVX, DAT, WMV, XVID, X264, WMV1, and SEC. Features for these files include Labelling, FacePro, ImagePro, and SpeechTotext, which is a 3rd party solution.

GEODI supports social media and web content, including HTML, HTM, MHT, RSS, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. It also supports various databases such as Oracle, Postgres, DB2, SQLServer, Mongo, and Cassandra. File-based databases like Access, SQLite, MDB, ACCDB, ACCDE, ACDDT, and ACCDR are supported. GEODI can process files embedded or linked to databases, texts embedded in databases, and spatial information from systems like Oracle Spatial and Postgres.

GEODI supports compressed files including ZIP, ZIPX, RAR, 7Z, and 7ZIP, crawling all archives and the files contained within them. For CAD and GIS formats, it supports Autocad, Netcad, Microstation, ArcGIS, and Google Earth. Specific file types include DWG, NCZ, DGN, DXF, SHP, KML, GeoTIFF, ECW, SID, and IMG. GEODI360 supports SRTMAP, NMEA, GPX, GPS, FLIGHTPLAN, FPL, IGC, and XML, while Netcad supports NCZ, KSE, KSP, DRE, CKS, KAP, and DRK.

Additional formats supported by GEODI include TXT, XML, MPP (Microsoft Project Manager), UDF (Uyap Document Format), EYP (E-Correspondence Package), *.Drawio, MOBIDI, and MOBIDI Office.

GEODI Url is a GEODI-specific format designed to link a location, which can be a Point, Line, or Area, with a weblink. This format can be utilized for purposes such as defining a trekking route, a camping area, or a specific place within an industrial plant. GEODI Url does not index the content of the linked page; a webcrawler must be defined to perform that function.

The GEODI Url file structure includes several fields. The `url` field specifies the web address. `Türkçe` and `English` fields provide descriptions in Turkish and English, respectively. The `Geom` field allows for geometry in WKT format, requiring entry in Geographic WGS84 datum, with examples like POINT(33 42) or LINESTRING (30 10, 10 30, 40 40). The `geomdisplayname` field is used to determine the label of the geometry on the map.

GEODI allows users to define information not included within a file as external metadata. This is done using an XML file with a ".meta.xml" extension, placed in the same directory as the original file. This method is useful for defining a projection for CAD files with an unknown projection or for associating values such as a person or parcel. For example, a file named "World Map.DWG" would have its meta file named "World Map.DWG.meta.xml".

Any content within the ".meta.xml" file can be used to define structured data, representing one of GEODI's methods for structured data definition. The structure and naming conventions for metafiles can be specified in a separate jsettings file, which enables support for different forms of metafiles. This definition file must be located in the `[.\Settings\AttributeProvider\XMLMeta]` directory, and GEODI requires a restart if this file is modified.

An example of a metafile XML content structure includes "TargetExtension", which is optional and, if undefined, checks name matching with all files. "MainFileFormat" specifies how to check for name matching using `[FILE]` for the file name and `[EXT]` for the extension. "IgnoreMetaFile" is optional and, if left blank, the metafile is also indexed separately by GEODI. "GroupElement" defines the group node name in the XML. "KeyElement" is the optional key node name under the group node, where a projection expression is always considered a projection, such as EPSG or WKT. "ValueElement" is the value node name under the group node. "AreaElement" is the field type value under the group node, determining its position in the index as either Header or Content, with Content being displayed in summaries and Header as the default.

Beyond the core structure, metafile XML can include attributes for specific functionalities. A `base64` attribute can force a preview image. A `summary` attribute can force the preview of the summary to be displayed in all searches. A `viewer` attribute can set the address to be used for opening the content. Authorization can be managed with `permit` for authorized user lists and `deny` for prohibited user lists, both of which can contain user IDs, group IDs, or provider group ID lists.

Metafile XML can define projections for non-georeferenced files like DWG, where the coordinates in the DWG must correspond to the specified projection, such as EPSG:4326 or WKT Projection. It can also add text to content, useful for annotating image or video files. Any text defined here is added to the existing information, and if the `AreaElement` value is "Content", it will be displayed in summaries, otherwise, the default is "Header".

Metafile XML can be used to add Geometry to any content, defined using WKT GEOMETRY. It also supports authorization-based content display, which works in addition to standard authorization systems like LDAP. The `permit` field lists authorized users, and `deny` lists forbidden users, both accepting user IDs, group IDs, or provider group ID lists. If a file is forbidden to a user in LDAP, the meta.xml cannot override that restriction.
