MediaMon is a social media monitoring tool that makes social media messages searchable and analyzes them, similar to other content. It can recognize Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram as sources.

MediaMon can be utilized by institutions and organizations as a tool for citizen or customer relationship management. It facilitates faster action on important social media messages by directing them to relevant units using GEODI's notification capabilities, effectively providing a 24/7 social media monitoring team member. The source data for this process is not limited to social media, as emails and forms from the institution's website can also be included.

Incoming messages are displayed on a map based on their content, eliminating the need for a separate GIS integration. For instance, a message like "I live on 112 street in Sincan. We want a nice children's park in our neighborhood" will show 112 street on the map, and Sincan will also be marked, regardless of whether the message explicitly contains location data. These messages are then directed to the appropriate unit, either automatically or manually, using GEODI's note-taking mechanism.

MediaMon enables trend research for larger datasets, allowing users to identify popular topics or the discussion volume around competitor products. It can report on topics, hashtag frequencies, and tweet frequencies across different time periods. Topics and sentiments can be automatically extracted using special recognizers or the TextPro classification tool. GEODI's ability to consolidate synonyms significantly reduces variations within the data.

MediaMon incorporates recognizers that identify Hashtag (#x) and Mention (@x) expressions within content. These identified expressions are utilized in the MediaMon Media Monitoring Panel and also function as keys that link content for GEODI Discovery.

The Media Monitoring Panel displays the frequency and temporal distribution of hashtags and mentions from social media sources. The content of this panel adjusts according to the queries executed within GEODI.

To define a Twitter source, a Twitter account is required. A Twitter account linked with GEODI allows reading tweets from the timeline or search results. GEODI considers tweets from the linked account and tweets from accounts followed by it as content, with options to include mentions and links within tweets. GEODI's scanning depth for old tweets matches what Twitter search results can display. GEODI does not access private messages, associated email addresses, or Twitter passwords, and the connection can be severed at any time. GEODI can also analyze search results from public tweets, supporting detailed searches by keyword, person, place, and date. Search criteria can be categorized as positive, negative, or question, and retweeted tweets can be included or excluded.

Facebook source definition allows searching among posts and comments shared on Facebook. Users can read their own posts and those they follow by providing credentials, or scan public pages without logging in by adding their addresses. Posts matching a desired query can be retrieved by adding expressions to the query box. All posts visible to the user are scanned, and automatic scanning can be configured to scan only new posts at specific intervals. Previews of posts can be obtained by indexing images on the page.

Instagram source definition allows using posts from Instagram pages as content sources, operating in two modes: API mode and browser navigation mode. API mode requires account login to read only posts from that account and its feed. Browser navigation mode allows scanning public pages by adding links without logging in, or by logging in to scan pages followed by the account. Unlike Facebook, Instagram does not support keyword queries, and search results only return accounts.

The training scope for GEODI users includes topics such as what MediaMon is, hashtag and mention recognizers, awareness regarding obtaining social media content and access restrictions, the Media Monitoring Panel, and directing incoming messages using note-taking.

For GEODI administrators, the training scope covers which sources are used, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, e-mail, and web, within the context of MediaMon's objectives. It also addresses hashtag and mention recognizers, including details and potential problems for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The MediaMon Panel is covered, including questions about OCR, ImagePro, and FacePro with images from social media, converting social media messages into tasks, and performing detailed analyses with Discovery. Awareness topics include potential problems, query definition, security updates on linked accounts and their effects, unwanted posts, Twitter query methods, and automatic scanning, concluding with a question and answer session.
