The GEODI note mechanism provides a practical and effective way to collaborate, helping users avoid unnecessary emails and the associated chaos of attached documents. When reviewing a contract, editing becomes significantly easier due to notes taken by colleagues on specific clauses. Document versioning within GEODI ensures that the entire process and all participants are logged.

With GEODI CAD & GIS viewers, users can take spatial notes directly on locations. This functionality is applicable to architectural projects or any spatial data format supported by GEODI, guiding individuals precisely to relevant points and eliminating uncertainties. A note taken on a Word or PDF file will navigate to the relevant page, while a note on an AutoCAD or Netcad file will navigate to the relevant coordinate. For videos, a note will navigate to the specific second or timestamp.

"Note" is recognized as a document type within GEODI, allowing users to query only notes using the expression "doc:*.geodinote." Users can also search within the content of notes; for example, "doc:*.geodinote positive" will find notes containing the word "positive." Furthermore, GEODI enables searching for the main document based on note content, using ‘child:”positive”’ to query documents associated with a note containing "positive." Notes taken on a document can be queried using the "parent2:" expression, and a report of notes taken on a document can also be generated.

GEODI facilitates tracking and management of notes by allowing searches based on the user who took the note, using the "owner:" expression. The Notes panel provides a view of all notes taken and the documents on which they were taken, simplifying process tracking. Users can determine who will see each note and can mention other users within notes using "@" to enable email notifications. These email notifications provide recipients with direct access to the specific page in the document where the note was taken.

When notes are taken in GEODI, GEODI identifiers are active, and recognized content is marked accordingly. If there is a defined status dictionary based on the source, it can be used to ensure standardized note-taking practices.

GEODI's process management capabilities include features such as note-taking, dashboards, queries, and monitoring, which together provide practical process management and traceability. Users can monitor the status of tasks through dashboards or queries and have the ability to create custom dashboards tailored to their organization's specific requirements.

In contrast to classical software where a process typically begins with a record, GEODI's process management initiates with a document. This document-centric approach simplifies tasks, prevents unnecessary data entry, and allows users to concentrate on their work.

For example, a job application process in GEODI starts with a CV document, eliminating the need for additional data entry that would be required in traditional software to re-enter information like the applicant's name, school, date of birth, or certifications. Users can simply drag and drop the CV to begin the process, and GEODI automatically recognizes and associates names or ID numbers, removing the need to separately associate certificates or other documents. Those evaluating the application are notified of added documents, provide their positive or negative feedback, and this feedback is then sent to those organizing interviews, ensuring a smooth continuation of the process.

Another application of GEODI's process management is in handling social media complaints, where a message is treated as a document. Users can take notes on the message, and by writing the name of the relevant person or department in the note, the concerned parties are informed. GEODI's intelligent methods can also automatically determine the relevant department based on the content of the complaint.

GEODI simplifies the monitoring of construction permit processes for municipalities or provincial special administrations, which involve multiple stakeholders such as the municipality, building inspection companies, contractors, and property owners. It helps ensure that all necessary documents are completely collected. Users can learn from the experiences of organizations like Aksaray Municipality and Artvin Provincial Special Administration through webinars.

In project processes, particularly for construction companies and engineering offices that produce projects in formats such as AutoCAD, Microstation, Netcad, ArcGIS, or GeoTIFF, GEODI simplifies the maturation process. These projects often generate numerous versions, and tracking them can be difficult and error-prone due to varied file names in directories and email attachments. GEODI addresses this by providing versioning and reducing errors through the identification of similar and duplicate documents.

Utilizing GEODI for process management offers speed, practicality, and smoothness, serving as an alternative to traditional software that relies on manual data entry, which employees or external stakeholders may find challenging to comply with.
