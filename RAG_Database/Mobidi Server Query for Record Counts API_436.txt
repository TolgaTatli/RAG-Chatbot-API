A token with query authorization is required to access the REST API. The JSON results of this API can be reached using any client.

The "Query" operation is described as returning a count of records grouped by layers corresponding to the query. Further details on all functions, including parameter and response types, are available on the technical page of MobidiQueryManagerHandler.

The request for this operation is structured as `[MOBIDISERVERURL]/MobidiQueryManagerHandler?op=QueryCounters&queryObject=[MobidiQuery_JSON]&UserSession=[TOKEN]`. The `queryObject` parameter is defined as a `MobidiQuery` object in JSON format. Both GET and POST are supported HTTP methods.

The defined error types include 401 Unauthorized access / Access denied, 403 Forbidden, 511 Network Authentication Required, and 501 Server Error.

The response for this operation is an array of `QueryCounter` objects.

A request example demonstrates sending a POST request to `[MOBIDIServerUrl]/MobidiQueryManagerHandler?op=Query`. This request includes a `queryObject` derived from `myQuery`, which specifies a `startDate` of "20180114" (January 14, 2018) and an `endDate` of "-1w" (up to 1 week ago). A `callBackFunction` is provided to alert the length of the received data.

A response example shows an array of objects, each containing `Layer_Id`, `Layer_Name`, and `Result_Count` properties.
