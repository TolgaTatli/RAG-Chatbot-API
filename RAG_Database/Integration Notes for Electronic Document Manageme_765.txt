A large number of integration models can be produced between GEODI and software like electronic document management systems (EDMS) and archive software. These models are mainly based on requesting GEODI from the related software. Requesting GEODI by EDMS or archive software solves many complex processes from the beginning, eliminating the need to share the database where documents are stored. Additionally, complex authorization mechanisms do not need to be resolved by GEODI, and GEODI does not need to understand the life cycle of the documents.

When a new document arrives, all incoming documents, attachments, and metadata can be sent using the Geodi Feed API (FeedHandler). This Feed API also includes privileges, which apply to GEODI as long as the users of GEODI and the integrated software are matched. If the intention is to use GEODI to extract metadata or index information, the Geodi Data Extraction API (Formatter) can be utilized when a new document is added, allowing GEODI to provide details such as dates and parcel numbers from the document. If the Geodi Feed API (FeedHandler) is already in use, the Geodi Query API (Query) option can be employed to avoid adding the same content twice.

The Geodi Feed API (FeedHandler) is also used for managing changes to documents. When an access right of a document changes, the updated authorizations are notified to GEODI again with the Geodi Feed API. Similarly, if the content of a document changes, the modified content must be passed to GEODI using FeedAPI, enabling GEODI to update according to this change. When the index or metadata of a document changes, manually generated index or metadata values can be sent to GEODI alongside the document itself, with FeedAPI being the method used, and a metadata change is also counted as a version change.

Before integration, a batch transfer to GEODI must be performed once for all data that already exists in the EDMS or archive software. This bulk transfer is again done using FeedAPI. It is useful to design this as a night-time task if there are many documents. The Geodi Feed API - Integration with Application Services (GEODI â†’ APP) can also be considered for bulk transfers.

Documents can be opened either in the user's own software or in GEODI, with the Feed API providing this option. For search functionality, GEODI Full is a text search software that can also perform search operations like 'files nearby' based on location information, and semantic search capabilities based on dates in the content. These capabilities can be used in several ways within the user's software: by using the GEODI Search API to interpret the returned result and visualize it according to specific standards, or by easily integrating the GEODI Search result into the software with an iframe, as theme support for visual differences is available at GEODI.

Authorization is managed by taking into account the permissions and prohibitions transmitted by the Feed API in GEODI queries. This ensures that if a user cannot access a document through the EDMS or archive software, they also cannot access it in the GEODI query.
