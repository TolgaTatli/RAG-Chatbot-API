It is possible to create a policy to classify all documents created by person A within an institution as confidential.

Documents can be selected and limited using the `owner:A` query.

Alternatively, documents visible to user A can be selected using `user:A`.

Date and all capabilities supported by GEODI can be added to these queries.
