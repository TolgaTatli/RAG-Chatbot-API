GEODI operates under the motto of Search-Discover-Classify-Mask. While data discovery is commonly associated with regulations such as GDPR or PCI/DSS, GEODI provides capabilities that extend beyond the data discovery requirements of these regulations.

GEODI tools facilitate the discovery of critical relationships between people, dates, and places, which is valuable in various professions and businesses. These tools can easily perform analyses such as identifying individuals who appear together in documents or photographs, associating place names with a person, or finding individuals related to a specific word, place, or date. The tools are designed for ease of use and deliver effective results, benefiting professionals like lawyers, press consultants, independent auditors, inspectors, experts, managers, and those involved in digital forensics.

GEODI data discovery tools recognize various entities within data, including names, place names, addresses, ID numbers, credit card numbers, company names, and user-defined entities. These recognized entities serve as summaries of the content and are referred to as 'words' within GEODI. A relationship can be established if two people appear in the same document, or if person names are in close proximity within the same document. Additionally, if the same name appears across different documents, those documents can be considered related.

GEODI is designed to process over 200 data sources, encompassing a wide range of digital data. This includes documents scanned with OCR, as well as files from databases, Word, Excel, Open Office, emails, UYAP files, videos, and images. GEODI can process various document types such as invoices, reports, proposal documents, project files, specifications, and contracts. The system also allows for the addition of new data sources not explicitly listed.

In GEODI, a basic query for two names, such as `Name1 Name2`, will return content where both names are present, even if they are far apart within the document. To address this, GEODI provides a special proximity search operator. For instance, `Name1(10)Name2` specifies that the two names must be within a maximum of 10 words of each other. Users can adjust this proximity value, for example, `Name1(5)Name2` or `Name1(20)Name2`. The default 10-word distance is chosen based on the average paragraph size, and users are advised to determine the distance value based on their intuition.

The rule for specifying proximity between a name and a place name in GEODI is identical to that for two names, exemplified by `Name(10)CityName`. GEODI also supports alternative spellings and variations in queries. The `*` operator can be used to cover variations such as "from [CityName]" or "in [CityName]", while the `~` operator accounts for misspellings.

GEODI queries allow for the simultaneous application of multiple criteria. For instance, a query like `Name1(10)Name2 economy` will locate content where two specified names are in close proximity and the word "economy" is also present. Users can add an unlimited number of criteria to their queries. An example is `economy dates(2023-01-01, 2023-03-31)`, which retrieves content containing "economy" and dates within January to March 2023. GEODI's semantic features enable it to identify the correct date format regardless of language, format, or alphabet.

Beyond simply listing content in the "Contents" tab, GEODI queries offer additional information through various view options. These include the Words, Calendar, Network Graph, and Map views, each providing more comprehensive insights than a basic content listing.

The Words page in GEODI displays names, dates, and other information in proximity to queried entities, such as those found with `Name1(10)Name2`. Users can refine the displayed information by selecting specific facets like dates or places; otherwise, all discovered words are shown. This page also supports queries for proximity to a single entity, for example, `Name()`, which will yield dates close to the specified name. Such single-entity proximity queries influence the Map, Calendar, and Network Graph views, but do not alter the results in the Contents view.

The Calendar page in GEODI is automatically generated from date information extracted from texts. When a query is performed, dates from the matching content are displayed. For example, a search for `Economy` will show all dates from documents containing the word "Economy," whereas `Economy()` will narrow the results to only dates in close proximity to "Economy." The dates, including their frequency over time, are presented in a calendar format, allowing users to click on a date to access the corresponding document.

The Map page in GEODI visualizes "Location" words, which are entities with associated coordinates such as parcels, place names, or area codes with phone numbers. When a query like `Economy` is entered, the map displays locations from documents where "economy" is mentioned. Using `Economy()` will show locations that are in close proximity to the word "Economy," which can help identify cities where the economy is prominent in news. Other examples include `drilling()` to view drillings in a construction company's archive, and `division()` to see parcels related to division in municipality documents.

The Network Graph is a component of the GEODI Discovery Module, designed to visualize relationships. It can display connections between words, between words and documents, or between documents and words.

The GEODI FacePro application is capable of recognizing faces in both photos and videos. This feature enables users to perform queries, similar to the other described functionalities, for individuals who appear together in the same photograph.
