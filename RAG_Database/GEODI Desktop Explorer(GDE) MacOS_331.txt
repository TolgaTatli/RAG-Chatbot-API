GDE MACOS installation is performed by using a click-to-run method on the downloaded *.pkg package.

After the GDE MACOS installation is complete, TOKEN and URL settings are configured within the Settings.json.sample file on the client machine.

Once these settings are made, the file's name is changed and saved as a JSON file using the command: $ sudo cp /Applications/GDE/Settings.json.sample /Applications/GDE/Settings.json.

When the special settings file for the initial installation is modified, GDE MACOS and Linux must be restarted.
