When a model is used within GEODI Api / x86 / x64 folders, the entire connection with the application or data must be implemented in the security model assembly.

For further details, one should refer to the "Enumerator (Connector/Adapter) Concept" document.

If an application is a library or adapter, it can choose to feed with this method, provided that an active application is not running.
