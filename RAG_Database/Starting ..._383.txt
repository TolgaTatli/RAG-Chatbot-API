As a developer, GEODI is composed of two main parts: the engine and user interfaces. The engine is responsible for providing all core functionality and exposes a REST API for all of its features.

The user interfaces of GEODI are built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and they rely on the GEODI REST API. Developers can inspect the HTML by pressing F12 to understand how a function utilizes GEODI.

Certain components of the GEODI user interface can be integrated as iframes, allowing developers to directly embed elements like maps, query results, or viewers into their own code. This capability can potentially save significant development time, and developers retain control over the look and feel of these integrated components.

The API documentation for GEODI is structured into two parts. The first part, found on "This site," offers extensive, detailed documentation on the basic API, including sample applications in various languages and embedded forms for direct experience with API calls.

The second part of the API documentation is GEODI itself. Accessing the "/API" URL opens a developer page that lists available methods, parameters, and provides access to fundamental functions such as token creation.

GEODI also includes an FAQ section, which compiles previously asked questions and their answers. It is strongly recommended that users review the FAQ before delving deeper into their software development.

Support Q possesses knowledge regarding the API and can address certain questions, but she is not able to write code for users.
