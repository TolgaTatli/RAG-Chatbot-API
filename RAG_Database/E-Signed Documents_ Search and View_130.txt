GEODI displays the signature information and timestamp information of E-Signed PDF files and allows searching from this information. This increases reliability without the need for external verification methods.

Signature information of PDF documents signed with the PAdES method is automatically recognized by GEODI during indexing. This information, including signatories, timestamps, and certificate details, is displayed when the document is opened.

No additional work is required for users to recognize e-signed documents, as GEODI performs this automatically. Users can search through e-signatures using query commands such as e-signature:... or signature:..... For example, searching for e-signature: "name surname" will find documents e-signed by the person "name surname".

When a document with an e-signature is selected, all e-signature information can be seen on the right side. In the Words screen, it is visible that discovered words come from the e-signature. On the document viewer screen, e-signature details can be viewed using the top right Info (I) button.
