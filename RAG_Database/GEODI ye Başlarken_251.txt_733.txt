These pages provide information on how to use GEODI and detailed information for system administrators. GEODI is designed to simplify tasks for employees working in both office and field environments. It accelerates access to information and facilitates sharing. GEODI is easy to use, allowing users to begin immediately after a very short training, and its ease of use increases with continued use. User training materials for GEODI can be found on the 'GEODI Eğitimleri' page.

The GEODI Search Page is the most frequently utilized section of the system. This page provides access to various features such as search functionalities, different viewing modes like Map and Calendar, note-taking capabilities, reports, and panels. Users can initiate a search by typing their query, which can include words and other criteria. Search results are displayed in a dedicated area, allowing navigation using the mouse wheel, and the total number of results is indicated in the top left corner.

Upon clicking any content within the search results, a list of options appears, including 'Open' to view the content. The available options may vary based on the content type, and features like note-taking, copying, and similar content are also presented. Holding 'ctrl' while clicking will open the content directly within the current area. The 'Facet' area is available to streamline and refine search queries.

Search results in GEODI can be displayed in multiple formats, including Explorer, Calendar, and Map views. The 'İçerikler' (Contents) view lists files and other content from the search results, allowing navigation with the mouse wheel. The 'Kaşif' (Explorer) view provides a structure similar to Windows Explorer, enabling users to navigate through directories containing their content. The 'Harita' (Map) view displays locations found within the content on a map, allowing users to access content by clicking on the map. The 'Takvim' (Calendar) view automatically generates a calendar from date information present in the content, enabling users to access relevant documents by clicking on a specific date. The 'Notlar' (Notes) panel allows users to monitor their taken notes and the content associated with those notes, with the possibility of other panels being present depending on the user's environment. Additionally, a 3-dot menu offers options such as language selection, reporting, and view settings.

GEODI's Content Viewers allow direct display of a wide range of content types without requiring external software. While a Word document is used as an example, GEODI supports various content types including DWG, NCZ, Videos, and Emails, each with specific viewers. Common functionalities across all these viewers are described. Within the content viewer, users can view their document and navigate vertically using the mouse wheel. The 'ctrl' key combined with mouse movement can enlarge the document, and right-clicking enables note-taking at any desired location within the document.

When a search query yields numerous results, GEODI's content viewer allows users to open and navigate through them sequentially without needing to return to the main search results. A panel on the right side of the viewer displays information such as words, metadata, notes, copies, and versions related to the content, with additional attachments possible depending on the content type. To download a version of the document that precedes the most current one, the 'shift+indir' (shift+download) key combination can be used, provided that backup functionality is enabled for older versions. Furthermore, an area within the viewer lists options like downloading or masking, with masking being available if the user possesses the necessary license. Users can also perform searches within the currently open document.

As of GEODI version 7.0.1.26858, documents viewed within the viewer can be downloaded. The viewer currently supports downloading from backup for DWG files. To download the most current version of a versioned document from the ES interface, users can utilize the 'Shift+İndir' (Shift+Download) key combination.
