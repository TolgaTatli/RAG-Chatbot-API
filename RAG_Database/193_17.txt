Sharepoint Online and OneDrive environments allow for data destruction and quarantine, as determined by a discovery made in these environments.

To enable data destruction and quarantine in Sharepoint Online and OneDrive, an open-source application named RCLONE must be installed and activated for these resources. RCLONE functions by presenting the aforementioned resources as if they were local folders.

It is assumed that the quarantine area is a local or network directory, and not located within the Sharepoint or OneDrive environments.

Under these specified conditions, the data destruction and quarantine process can be executed using the existing method of "script generate/script run."
