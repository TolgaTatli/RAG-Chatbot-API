GEODI analyzes CRM Data and reveals hidden values in data through Data Discovery, Data Masking, Data Classification, and Insight capabilities.

GEODI aims to cover all assets with over 200 data adapters to enable more effective and efficient Search, Data Discovery, Data Classification, Data Masking, and analysis.

DECE Software has added Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Zoho CRM as new adapters. GEODI's Low-Code web service integration feature allows for regular indexing of Users, Organizations, opportunities, and proposes, which paves the way for semantic enterprise search and Data Discovery.

CRM records can be opened where they are located, meaning records in Zoho CRM open within Zoho CRM.

GEODI and its capabilities can be used for various purposes, including GDPR Compliance, combining other software used within an organization, and utilizing GEODI's features for archived and file-based data.

GEODI's integrated map capability allows users to view customers or visits on a map and identify concentrated areas using a heat map. This map can provide results not extractable from CRM.

GEODIâ€™s analysis and Insights capabilities are designed to unlock the hidden value of data, complementing the map's dimension.
