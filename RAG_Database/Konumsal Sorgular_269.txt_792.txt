GEODI is a GIS solution that features a powerful query language for spatial relationships. This capability enables direct querying of unstructured data using words, semantic rules, and spatial relationships. This functionality significantly saves time and resources compared to traditional GIS solutions.

GEODI finds content by utilizing geometric words such as places, points, section numbers, island parcels, roads, addresses, MGRS coordinates, or photos with GPS. The content found is displayed on CONTENT pages, while the words are located on the KEYWORDS page. Additionally, the map will show the query results.

GEODI's spatial query rules include: bbox, Intersects, Contains, Within, Equals, Touches, Related (which combines Contains, CoveredBy, and Touches), Distance, Covers, Overlaps, CoveredBy, and Crosses.

The Keywords page lists all words found within the content. However, the Word proximity rule and geographic queries can alter this. When the proximity rule is applied, only close words remain, and for geographic queries, only words that match the geographic query are retained.

To apply geographic query rules, the suffix "doc" must be added to the rule. For example, "Distance:"Ankara geodistance:5000"" finds all documents containing locations around Ankara and 5000 meters, including both geographic and non-geographic words within these documents. In contrast, "DistanceDoc:"Ankara geodistance:5000"" finds the same content but limits the geographic words to those within approximately 5000 meters of Ankara.

Examples of GEODI's spatial query usage include: "Related:42.5,36.4" for a single longitude,latitude point; "Related:42.5,36.4,43.8,38.5" for an area or line defined by longitude,latitude,longitude,latitude coordinates, where the first and last coordinates must be identical for an area; and "Related:42.5,36.4,46.0,36.4,43.2,32.1,42.5,36.4" for a multi-point area or line. Other examples are "Intersects:"Line 42.5,36.4,46.0,36.4"" for a line intersection, "Touches:"10 Ada 5 Parsel"" for entities touching a specific parcel, "Distance:"Ankara geodistance:50000"" for entities within 50km of Ankara, "Within:"Ankara geocenter"" for entities containing Ankara's center, and "Related:"Eskişehir Yolu geobuffer:10"" for entities within 10 meters of Eskişehir Road. It is important that coordinate expressions do not contain unnecessary spaces.
