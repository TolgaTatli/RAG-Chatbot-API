GEODI's discovery and search capabilities are technologically supported by the active use of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a critical technology for processing unstructured data. A discovery tool needs to find sensitive data in texts without rules, and GEODI accomplishes this challenging task with NLP. NLP is one of the key actors behind GEODI's high-accuracy discovery.

NLP functions enable GEODI to discover person names, monetary expressions, dates, document types, special categories of personal data, and similar or duplicate documents. GEODI, which is based on NLP functions, also assists with searching, discovering, or classifying semantic queries. For example, users can search for documents containing phrases like "over 1 million dollars" and IBANs. These semantic queries can also be converted into automatic classification rules. Users can search for document types, date ranges, and more. GEODI's semantic features can also play a role in creating automatic classification policies.
