GEODI and MOBIDI offer many possibilities for developers.

Both GEODI and MOBIDI software consist of two essential layers: an Engine and HTML5/JSON/Javascript interfaces.

Developers can either create an entirely different interface or make Engine calls from the software they developed.

Replacing the existing GEODI interfaces with custom CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript is also possible. Developers can either edit the whole interface or simply change a feature on the corresponding page.
