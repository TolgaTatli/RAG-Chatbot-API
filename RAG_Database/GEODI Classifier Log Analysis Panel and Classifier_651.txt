The classification and log analysis panel template projects become ready upon the installation of the classification module. In projects where classification activities are monitored, classification movements are regularly recorded. These classification logs can be written to a database and subsequently monitored and analyzed by any SIEM tool or Log Analysis Panel.

The GEODI Log Analysis Panel allows users to monitor classification activities and perform analysis on a user and class basis. This panel requires the logs to be stored in a Database. Once the Classification Module is installed, the project will be automatically activated.

Through the GEODI Log Analysis Panel, users can review various types of information. This includes Classes, the Number of Classifications by Applications, and the Number of Classifications by Users. Additionally, Classified Contents can be reviewed, along with a trend analysis of the number of classifications by Month, Week, and Year.

The system processes data contained within GEODI log records, and new log entries are automatically processed according to a defined scan for changes. Logs may be in formats such as CSV, CEF, Syslog, or Database, and GEODI Logs are compatible for use in SIEM applications. For information regarding other log types, users can check the GEODI Logs page.

GEODI log records include several specific fields. These fields are Object ID, which is a Unique ID; Log Time, indicating the Time of transaction; and Log User, identifying the User who performed the classification. Other fields include Log App, which is GEODI; Log App Ver, for GEODI Version; Log Module, specified as DLP Classifier; Log Security Level, which can be https veya http; and Log Level, set to medium.

Further fields within GEODI log records provide details about the classified content and method. The File field contains the UNCPath of classified content, with an example provided as C:\Users\ \Desktop\New Word Doc (2).docx. Logs also record the Previous Class and the Current Class, where a value of “?” indicates content without a class. The Class field specifies the Given Class, while the Source field indicates the Method of classification, such as Shell or Add-In. Client IP and Client User fields record the Client IP and Client Username, respectively.

The AutoClass column in GEODI logs provides the ID value of the class determined automatically, if it was used as an automatic recommendation or forcibly. If automatic classification has never been used for a particular entry, the AutoClass field will be logged as empty.

The Action Type field in GEODI logs details how a classification was applied. "Auto" signifies an automatically assigned class, while "Manuel" and "Offline" both indicate a manual class was selected, with "Offline" specifically noting GDE and Shell. "AUTOCLASS Body Email" means classification was automatic with "%AUTOCLASS%" text in Outlook desktop. "Auto Menu Click" refers to classification by automatic clicking on the Add-In, and "Class Menu Click" is for classification by selecting a class through the Add-In. "Form UI" indicates a form interface was opened and selection made through the form. "Forced AutoClass" means automatic classification was enforced.
