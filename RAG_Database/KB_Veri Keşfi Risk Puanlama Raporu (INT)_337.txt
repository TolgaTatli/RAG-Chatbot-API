The GEODI Content Risk Report allows for the calculation of content-based risk scores after discovery.

Risk calculation involves assigning a risk score between 0 and 100 to each source. Sources without an assigned risk score are assumed to have a risk score of 0, indicating no risk. Sources like shared file areas, which should not contain sensitive data, should have a high risk value, while protected areas like databases should have a low risk value. The user determines the risk score for each source.

Findings and identifiers are also taken into account for risk calculation. In the default report, identifiers such as credit card, IBAN, CVV, PIN, password, name, TCNO, e-mail, address, VKN, foreign ID, and passport are considered risky.

For each content item, the report includes values from the Content List, along with the source's risk score (the value entered by the user), the number of risky identifiers, and a calculated risk score. The calculated risk score is determined by multiplying the source risk by the number of risky identifiers.

This report is more than 2 times slower than the Content List and places a greater load on the system. Therefore, it should be used carefully and only when necessary.

The report is located within the GEODI Discovery module. Users must be members of the ACC.Discovery group to access it.

To determine a source's risk score, a risk value between 0 and 100 must be defined when adding sources in the Project Wizard. If the risk option is not selected, the source risk value is accepted as zero.

If a source is a database (VT), the risk will not appear in the report even if it has been defined. The Content List and Risk Report are not available for VT sources.
