In most organizations, up to 40% of documents are duplicates or similar, which creates confusion, complicates search results, and wastes storage space. This duplicate or similar content can be scattered across multiple sources, including different folders, drives, emails, and systems, with a single file potentially having dozens of copies. GEODI automatically detects duplicate or similar content across data sources, helping users focus on clean, deduplicated content for more efficient discovery, classification, and reporting. A copy is defined as the same content, and duplicity or similarity is calculated based on content, not format, meaning a PDF and DOCX may be duplicates or similar, and images are included.

GEODI offers "Find All Duplicates" queries to locate duplicate content, though these queries are not suitable for remediation; `duplicate2` or `original2` should be used for that purpose instead. Specific queries include `duplicate:(doc:a.pdf)` to find copies of `a.pdf`, and `duplicate:"Georgia Aquarium"` to find a copy document containing those words. GEODI can also list all documents that have duplicates, or list only unique documents that do not have any duplicates.

For identifying and managing duplicate content, GEODI provides queries that separate original documents from their duplicates. For instance, if there are 10 duplicates, one query can return all nine duplicates within a target dataset, while another query returns only the single original document per duplicate set. This approach helps clean content, reduce storage, and improve the precision of search and reporting. `Duplicate2` is effective for removing duplicate content when used with a Destroy Workflow.

The `duplicate2` query offers parameters to specify how to choose the original among duplicate files when no source list is defined. `duplicate2:(order:New|Old)` allows older versions to be treated as originals, or newer versions to be kept with older ones marked as duplicates. `duplicate2:(i:Source1,Source2,...)` signifies "Important" and keeps duplicates in the listed sources, marking duplicates existing elsewhere for deletion or action. Conversely, `duplicate2:(ni:Source1,Source2,...)` means "Not Important," indicating that if a duplicate exists outside these sources, files in the listed sources can be safely deleted.

The `original2:(..)` query is exclusively used to find original documents and functions as the opposite of `duplicate2`, utilizing the same parameters and interpretation. Together, `duplicate2` and `original2` queries provide complete control over how GEODI handles duplicates, enabling cleanup that is safer, smarter, and aligned with organizational priorities.

GEODI can also find similarities between text and image contents, similar to how it finds duplicates, but similarity has a degree. While all duplicates are also considered similar, they can be excluded from similarity results. Users can limit the similar count by a number, set the similarity index (with a default of 0.7), and choose whether to exclude copies (default is false, meaning copies are listed under similar). Specific queries include `similar:(doc:a.pdf)` to find content similar to `a.pdf`, and `similar:‚ÄùGeorgia Aquarium"` to find similar documents containing those words.

When managing large sets of similar, but not identical, documents, the goal is often to retrieve only one representative document rather than every variant. This process improves search efficiency and aids in cleaning up redundant content through actions like deletion or quarantine. GEODI provides queries for this, such as one that returns a single document per group with 70% or more similarity (the default threshold), or another that returns only one document from groups with 90%+ similarity. Queries can also filter within the results of a custom query, such as a folder or date range, and can include documents that do not have any similar matches in the result set.
