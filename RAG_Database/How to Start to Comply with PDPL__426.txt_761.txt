The Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) introduces various requirements for businesses operating in numerous GCC and Middle East countries, including the UAE, KSA, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, and Egypt. GEODI Data Protection Solutions supports PDPL by accounting for minor country-specific differences, such as variations in ID and tax numbers. GEODI Discovery is capable of discovering, masking, and anonymizing these differing data points.

GEODI's high-speed, high-accuracy discovery and classification engine enables work on heterogeneous data, meaning it can simultaneously handle IDs compliant with PDPL, USA, and European regulations. Compliance reports can be generated from different data sources, including File servers, SharePoint, databases, e-mails, and PCs. This bulletin specifically details how GEODI addresses PDPL compliance needs.

The initial crucial step in complying with Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) regulations is data discovery. This process is essential for identifying what personal data an organization holds, where it is stored, and how it is processed, thereby helping to catalog all instances of personal data across various systems and storage locations.

Data discovery also allows organizations to understand the flow of personal data both within and outside the organization. This includes how data is collected, processed, transferred, and stored, which is vital for mapping data processes and ensuring compliance. Furthermore, by discovering where sensitive and personal data resides, organizations can assess the risks associated with data breaches, unauthorized access, and data loss, a critical step for implementing appropriate security measures.

GEODI offers semantic data discovery, allowing users to scan and identify personal data across all data repositories, such as structured databases, unstructured files, emails, and cloud storage. It facilitates the creation of an inventory of personal data, documenting its type, location, and processing. GEODI includes ready-to-use recognizers for local regulations, enabling immediate use without manual work.

Following data discovery, GEODI supports data classification, where data is categorized based on sensitivity and regulatory requirements to apply appropriate security measures and handling protocols. Organizations can establish classification policies aligned with PDPL requirements to ensure accurate data categorization. GEODI provides ready-to-use classification rules and templates specifically for PDPL.

GEODI's data masking and anonymization functions protect sensitive personal data, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. These functions help ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data and allow for data obfuscation when data is shared or processed in less secure environments.

Data remediation involves taking corrective actions to secure personal data, such as encrypting, deleting, or anonymizing unnecessary or outdated data, based on GEODI's Semantic Discovery results. Implementing policies for regular data cleanup and maintenance is also part of ensuring ongoing compliance.

For compliance monitoring and reporting, continuous monitoring systems can be established to track data access, modifications, and transfers, aiding in the detection and response to potential security incidents. GEODI's incremental scanning feature sends alarms upon detecting a non-compliant file or newly generated or modified data. Compliance reports and audit logs can be generated and maintained to demonstrate adherence to PDPL regulations during inspections or audits.

Procedures must be developed to handle data subject requests, including access, correction, deletion, and data portability requests, as mandated by PDPL. Organizations need to ensure that data subjects can easily exercise their rights and that their requests are responded to within stipulated timelines. GEODI Enterprise Search can provide these results quickly from millions of documents.

Starting with data discovery is fundamental for PDPL compliance, as it establishes the basis for understanding and managing personal data effectively. By identifying where personal data resides and how it is processed, organizations can implement suitable measures to protect data, ensure compliance, and mitigate risks associated with data breaches and non-compliance penalties. GEODI offers a compliance cycle that includes Search, Discovery, Masking, and Classification, providing ready-to-use templates and modules within a single platform.
